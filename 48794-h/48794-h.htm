<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface">Preface</a></h2>


<p><i>Pioneer Imprints From Fifty States</i> will enable
readers to view the Library of Congress collections
from an unaccustomed angle. It takes
for its subject the Library's earliest examples
of printing from within present-day boundaries
of each State in the Union, providing for each
in turn 1) a brief statement about the origin
of printing; 2) identification of the Library's
earliest examples&mdash;among them broadsides,
newspapers, individual laws, almanacs, primers,
and longer works; and 3) information, if available,
about the provenance of these rarities.</p>

<p>Each of the 50 sections may be consulted independently.
To those who read it through,
however, <i>Pioneer Imprints</i> will give some idea
of the movement of printers and presses across
the Nation, as well as insight into the nature
and history of the Library's holdings.</p>

<p>The author wishes to express his indebtedness
to Frederick R. Goff, Chief of the Library
of Congress Rare Book Division from 1945 to
1972, who has been constantly helpful and
encouraging; to Thomas R. Adams, Librarian
of the John Carter Brown Library, Providence,
R.I., who read the first 13 sections before their
publication under the title "The Library's Earliest
Colonial Imprints" in the <i>Quarterly Journal
of the Library of Congress</i> for July 1967;
and to Marcus A. McCorison, Director and
Librarian of the American Antiquarian Society,
Worcester, Mass., who read the manuscript of
the later sections. These scholars cannot, of
course, be held responsible for any errors or
faults in this bibliographical investigation. The
author's indebtedness to printed sources is revealed
to some extent by notes appearing at
the end of each section. He is obliged for
much of his information to the staffs of the
Library of Congress, the National Archives, and
the Smithsonian Institution, as well as to the
following correspondents: Alfred L. Bush,
Curator, Princeton Collections of Western
Americana, Princeton University Library; G.
Glenn Clift, Assistant Director, Kentucky Historical

<h2><a name="Massachusetts" id="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a></h2>


<p>Stephen Daye, the first printer of English-speaking
North America, established his press
at Cambridge late in 1638 or early in 1639
and printed the famed <i>Bay Psalm Book</i> there
in 1640. This volume of 295 pages is the first
substantial book and the earliest extant example
of printing from what is now the
United States. Mrs. Adrian Van Sinderen of
Washington, Conn., deposited an original copy
of the <i>Bay Psalm Book</i> in the Library of Congress
at a formal ceremony held in the Librarian's
Office on May 2, 1966. Mrs. Van
Sinderen retained ownership of the book during
her lifetime; it became the Library's property
upon her death, April 29, 1968.</p>

<p>The book is properly entitled <i>The Whole
Booke of Psalmes Faithfully Translated into
English Metre</i>. Of 11 extant copies this was
the last in private hands, and it filled the most
serious single gap in the Library's collection
of early American printing. It is an imperfect
copy, lacking its title page and 18 leaves.
Bound in calfskin, it is one of the five copies in
an original binding.</p>

<p>Zoltán Haraszti's authoritative study <i>The
Enigma of the Bay Psalm Book</i> (Chicago,
1956) includes information about all the surviving
copies. Mrs. Van Sinderen's copy was
one of five that were collected by scholarly
Thomas Prince of Boston (1687-1758), who
bequeathed his extensive library to Old South
Church. It was from the church that the Cambridge
wool merchant and Bible collector
George Livermore obtained it in 1849. By an
exchange agreement between Livermore and
the prominent bookseller Henry Stevens, 12
leaves were removed from the volume to complete
another copy, which Stevens sold to James
Lenox in 1855 and which now belongs to the
New York Public Library. Livermore's collection,
deposited at Harvard after his death, was
auctioned in 1894 in Boston, his <i>Bay Psalm
Book</i> realizing $425 and going to Mrs. Van
Sinderen's father, Alfred Tredway White of
Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Before 1966 the earliest Massachusetts imprint,
as well as the earliest imprint of the
Nation, in the Library was Richard Mather's
<i>The Summe of Certain Sermons upon Genes:
15.6</i>, printed at Cambridge in 1652. Its author
was the progenitor of the powerful Mather
family of New England divines, and he was
among the translators contributing to the <i>Bay
Psalm Book</i>. Its printer, Samuel Green, operated
the first Massachusetts printing press
after Stephen Daye's son Matthew died in
1649, Stephen having retired from the press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
in 1647. Mather's book contains his revised
notes for sermons preached at Dorchester.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress copy&mdash;one of four
extant&mdash;is inscribed by an early hand, "James
Blake his Booke." In the mid-19th century this
copy apparently came into the possession of
Henry Stevens, whereupon it was bound in
full morocco by Francis Bedford at London;
and it presumably belonged to the extensive
collection of Mather family books that Stevens
sold in 1866 to George Brinley, of Hartford,
Conn.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Library of Congress obtained the
volume with a $90 bid at the first sale of
Brinley's great library of Americana, held at
New York in March 1879.</p>

</div>

<p>A press that William Nuthead started at Jamestown
in 1682 was quickly suppressed, and
nothing of its output has survived. It was
William Parks who established at Williamsburg
in 1730 Virginia's first permanent press.
Here Parks issued the earliest Virginia imprint
now represented in the Library of Congress:
<i>A Collection of All the Acts of Assembly Now
in Force, in the Colony of Virginia</i> (1733).
Printing of this book may have begun as early
as 1730. In a monograph on William Parks,
Lawrence C. Wroth cites evidence "in the
form of a passage from Markland's <i>Typographia</i>,
which indicates that its printing was
one of the first things undertaken after Parks
had set up his Williamsburg press."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Two Library of Congress copies of this imposing
folio&mdash;one of them seriously defective&mdash;are
housed in the Law Library; while yet
another copy, which is especially prized, is
kept with the Jefferson Collection in the Rare
Book Division since it belonged to the library
which Thomas Jefferson sold to the Congress
in 1815.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The 1815 bookplate of the Library
of Congress is preserved in this rebound copy,
and Jefferson's secret mark of ownership can
be seen&mdash;his addition of his other initial to
printed signatures I and T. A previous owner
wrote "Robert [?] Lewis law Book" on a
flyleaf at the end, following later acts bound
into the volume and extending through the year
1742. He may well have been the same Robert
Lewis (1702-65) who served in the House of
Burgesses from 1744 to 1746.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The Library possesses the only known copy
of another early Virginia imprint bearing the
same date: Charles Leslie's <i>A Short and Easy
Method with the Deists. The Fifth Edition</i>....
Printed and sold by William Parks, at his
Printing-Offices, in Williamsburg and Annapolis,
1733. Inasmuch as an advertisement for this
publication in the <i>Maryland Gazette</i> for May
17-24, 1734, is headed "Lately Publish'd," it
was most likely printed early in 1734 but dated
old style, and so it probably followed the publication
of the <i>Acts of Assembly</i>. The Library
purchased the unique copy for $8 at the second
Brinley sale, held in March 1880.</p>

<p>After departing from Virginia, William
Nuthead set up the first Maryland press at
St. Mary's City sometime before August 31,
1685. This press continued in operation until
a few years after Nuthead's widow removed
it to Annapolis about 1695; yet nothing more
survives from it than a single broadside and
some printed blank forms.</p>

<p>In 1700 Thomas Reading began to operate
a second press at Annapolis, and his output
in that year included a collection of laws which
is the earliest Maryland imprint now represented
in the Library of Congress. Since the
Library's is the only extant copy, it is particularly
regrettable that its title page and considerable
portions of the text are lacking.
Catalogers have supplied it with the title:
<i>A Complete Body of the Laws of Maryland</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The copy was formerly in the possession of
the lawyer and diplomat John Bozman Kerr
(1809-78). It might not have survived to this
day were it not for his awareness of its importance,
as shown in his flyleaf inscription:</p>

</p></div>

<p>William Bladen, to whom the book is dedicated,
was then clerk of the Upper House and
had been instrumental in bringing Thomas
Reading to Maryland. In fact, the records indicate
that he assumed the role of publisher.
If John Bozman Kerr had had access to the
proceedings of the Lower House for the year
1700, he would have been most interested to
find there Bladen's written proposal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That if the house are desirous the body of Laws
should be printed soe that every person might easily
have them in their houses without being troubled
to goe to the County Court house to have recourse
thereto.</p>

<p>That the house made [sic] an Order for printeing
thereof and that every County be Oblidged to take
one faire Coppy endorsed and Titled to be bound
up handsomely and that for the encouragement of
the undertaker each County pay him therefore
2000<sup>lbs</sup> of Tob<sup>o</sup> upon delivery the said booke of
Laws....</p></div>

<p>This was approved on May 9.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The printing
was not wholly satisfactory, for on May 17

<h2><a name="Pennsylvania" id="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a></h2>


<p>Like William Nuthead, William Bradford
introduced printing in more than one Colony,
and he began his American career by establishing
the first Pennsylvania press at Philadelphia
in 1685. Here that same year he printed
<i>Good Order Established in Pennsilvania &amp;
New-Jersey in America</i>, the earliest Pennsylvania
imprint in the Library of Congress
and the second known example of Bradford's
press. The author, Thomas Budd, was a successful
Quaker immigrant, who settled first
at Burlington, N.J., and later at Philadelphia.
He intended his description of the two Colonies
to stimulate further immigration, and he
printed this statement on the title page verso:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is to be noted, that the Government of these
Countries is so settled by Concessions, and such
care taken by the establishment of certain fundamental
Laws, by which every Man's Liberty and
Property, both as Men and Christians, are preserved;
so that none shall be hurt in his Person,
Estate or Liberty for his Religious Perswasion or
Practice in Worship towards God.</p></div>

<p>Because neither place nor printer is named
in the book, it was long thought to have been
printed at London, but typographical comparisons
made during the latter part of the 19th
century demonstrated conclusively that it issued
from William Bradford's press.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 438px;">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" width="438" height="600" alt="The 19th-century bookseller Henry Stevens." />
<div class="caption"><i>The 19th-century bookseller Henry Stevens.</i></div>
</div>

<p>The Library of Congress copy was bound at
London by William Pratt for the bookseller
Henry Stevens. F. J. Shepard traces this much
of its later provenance in his introduction to
a reprint issued in Cleveland in 1902:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A copy in full levant morocco, by Pratt, belonging
to John A. Rice of Chicago, was sold in March,
1870, to Sabin &amp; Sons for $155. The same copy
fetched $150 at the sale of the library of William
Menzies of New York (1875),<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> when it was described
in Sabin's catalogue as "one of the rarest of
books relating to Pennsylvania." It was again,
presumably, the same copy which at the sale in
New York of S. L. M. Barlow's books in 1889
brought $400, although it was still incorrectly described
as printed in London. After passing through
the hands of two dealers and one collector, it
reached Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., who advertised it in
their November, 1900, catalogue for $700, and sold
it at that price to a private collector whose name
is not given.</p></div>

<p>The copy was among several Americana from
the library of C. H. Chubbock, a Boston collector,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
which were sold at auction by C. F. Libbie
&amp; Co. on February 23 and 24, 1904, the Library
of Congress obtaining it for $600.</p>

<h2><a name="New_York" id="New_York">New York</a></h2>


<p>William Bradford moved from Pennsylvania
to New York in the spring of 1693, but what
was the first product of his New York press has
not been established.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The Library of Congress
owns two Bradford imprints from this period,
neither containing any indication of the place
of publication. Nevertheless, both are listed in
Wilberforce Eames' bibliography of early
New York imprints.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> One of them, entitled
<i>New-England's Spirit of Persecution Transmitted
to Pennsilvania, and the Pretended
Quaker Found Persecuting the True Christian-Quaker,
in the Tryal of Peter Boss, George
Keith, Thomas Budd, and William Bradford,
at the Sessions Held at Philadelphia the
Nineth, Tenth and Twelfth Days of December,
1692. Giving an Account of the Most Arbitrary
Procedure of That Court</i>, has been conjectured
to be the first New York imprint
(Eames 1). Eames states that the work
"seems to be the joint production of George
Keith and Thomas Budd, including Bradford's
own account of the trial. As it mentions the
next Court Session of March, 1693, it could
hardly have been printed before May...." He
confesses that Bradford may have printed it at
Philadelphia. The Library of Congress purchased
its copy&mdash;one of six recorded in the
National Union Catalog&mdash;for $50 at the November
1876 auction of the library of Americana
formed by a New York collector, William
Menzies.</p>

<p>The other Bradford imprint conjecturally
assigned to New York is Governor Benjamin
Fletcher's proclamation of April 29, 1693,
prohibiting "the <i>Breaking of the LORDS
DAY</i>, all <i>Prophane Swearing, Cursing,
Drunkenness, Idleness</i> and <i>unlawful Gaming</i>,
and all manner of <i>Prophaneness</i> whatsoever"
(Eames 9). Eames gives no reason why this
broadside should be listed as a later imprint.
An eminent New Yorker, Stuyvesant Fish, presented
the unique copy to the Library of Congress
in 1915 and in an accompanying letter
to the Librarian told how it had come into his
possession:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The broadside now sent you was given me by
Mrs. Fish's mother, the late Mrs. William Henry
Anthon, with the statement that she had found it
among the papers left by her brother-in-law, Professor
Charles Edward Anthon (b. Dec. 6, 1823;
d. June 7, 1885). The latter was much given to
collecting coins, manuscripts, &amp;c., but no effort of
mine has enabled me to learn where, when or how
he became possessed of the paper.</p></div>

<p>In view of the uncertain assignment of these
two imprints to New York, the Library's
earliest imprints naming New York as the
place of publication should also be mentioned.
<i>A Catalogue of Fees Established by the Governour
and Council at the Humble Request of
the Assembly</i> (New-York, William Bradford,
1693) is an 11-page work printed sometime
after September 20, 1693. The Library's
copy, like others, is appended to Bradford's
printing of <i>The Laws &amp; Acts of the General
Assembly</i> (New-York, 1694), which in Eames'
opinion was itself probably begun in 1693, perhaps
as early as July or August. Among the
owners of the volume containing these early
imprints was the bibliographer Charles R.
Hildeburn, who gave the following history
in a note prefixed to an 1894 facsimile edition
of <i>The Laws &amp; Acts</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This [copy], lacking a title-page, was formerly
part of a volume of laws and other folio tracts
printed by Bradford between 1694 and 1710, which
was bought at a sale at Bangs's, in New-York, about
ten years ago, by the late Dr. George H. Moore, for
$26. In 1890 Dr. Moore sold the volume as he
bought it for $1750 to the writer, who, having supplied
the title-page in facsimile, sold so much of
"the Laws of 1694 as issued" as it contained to the
late Mr. Tower for $600. The volume then passed
by the gift of Mr. Towers's widow, with the Tower
collection, to the Historical society of Pennsylvania,
and, having been replaced by a perfect copy ...,
was sold to Dodd, Meade &amp; Company, of New-York
for $400. From the firm last mentioned it was purchased
by Mr. [Abram C.] Bernheim.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></div>

<p>Now in a full morocco binding by Bradstreet's,
the volume contains the bookplates of Abram
C. Bernheim, who lectured on New York history
at Columbia College, Henry C. Bernheim,
and Russell Benedict. At the New York auction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of Judge Benedict's library in 1922 Halstead
H. Frost, Jr., purchased it for $3,000;
yet in 1926 at an auction by the same house
of "Rare Americana including the collection
of the late A. R. Turner, Jr. and selections
from the collection of the late Charles A.
Munn," the same copy drew only $1,800. In
1931 the Library of Congress obtained it from
the firm of Lathrop C. Harper for $2,929.55,
and it was duly noted in the subsequent annual
report as "the most precious acquisition of the
year by the law library."</p>

<p>Thomas Short, who learned his trade at Boston,
became Connecticut's first printer when he
went to New London to do the official printing
for the Colony in 1709.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress owns two Thomas
Short imprints dated 1710, and one of them
is believed to be the first book printed in Connecticut:
<i>The Necessity of Judgment, and
Righteousness in a Land. A Sermon, Preached
at the General Court of Election, at Hartford
in the Colony of Connecticut, on May 11th.
1710. By Eliphalet Adams, Pastor of the
Church in New-London</i>. Eliphalet Adams was
an influential clergyman whose 43 years of
service at New London had just begun in
1709. The work is an election sermon, of a
type delivered annually at the opening of certain
New England legislatures. Although not
especially worthy of remembrance, it manages
to suggest the ceremony of the occasion. Adams
closes his sermon by addressing the Governor,
Deputy Governor, and magistrates, next turning
to the assembled clergy, and finally concluding:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shall I now turn my self to the <i>General Assembly
of the Colony at present met together</i>. And even
here I may promise my self an easie Reception, while
I plead for <i>Judgment</i> &amp; <i>Righteousness</i>. The welfare
of the Country is in a great measure Intrusted
in your hands and it is indeed a matter Worthy of
your best Thoughts and chiefest cares. It should
be Ingraven, if not upon the Walls of your House,
yet upon each of your Hearts, <i>Ne quid Detrimenti
Respublica Capiat</i>, <i>Let the Common-wealth receive
no damage</i>. It is in your power partly to
frame Laws for the Direction &amp; Government of the
people of the Land. Now too much care cannot be
taken, that they may be strictly agreable to the
standing Rules of Justice &amp; Equity, that they may
not prove a grievance in stead of an advantage to
the Subject; If the Rule be crooked, how shall our
manners be Regular?...<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></div>

<p>The Library of Congress copy, in a 19th-century
morocco binding, contains no evidence of
provenance, but it was undoubtedly in the Library's
possession by 1878, for the title is listed
in the Library catalog published that year.
Another copy sold at auction in 1920 for
$1,775, which was the largest amount ever paid
for a Connecticut imprint.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The Library's other Connecticut imprint
with a date of 1710 is entitled <i>A Confession
of Faith Owned and Consented to by the
Elders and Messengers of the Churches in the
Colony of Connecticut in New-England, Assembled
by Delegation at Saybrook September
9th. 1708</i>.... Herein is the historic Saybrook
Platform, whereby individual congregations of
the Colony submitted to the firmer control of
synods. There exists documentary evidence
that the printing of this book did not begin
until late in 1710, and apparently it was not
completed until 1711.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Elizabeth Short, the
printer's widow, was paid £50 in 1714 for
binding all 2,000 copies in calfskin and birchwood
covers.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The Library's copy retains the
original binding. Of further interest is the
evidence supplied by the Library's bookplate
that the volume formerly belonged to Peter
Force, the American historian and archivist,
whose notable collection was obtained through
a special Congressional appropriation in 1867.</p>

by William Bradford in the City of Perth-Amboy, 1723.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1723 William Bradford is thought by some
to have transported a press from New York to
Perth Amboy, then the capital of New Jersey,
to print paper currency for the Colony.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> If
this is true he was the first New Jersey printer,
although printing was not established there on
a permanent basis until three decades later. In
any event, in 1723 Bradford produced the first
book with a New Jersey imprint: <i>Anno Regni
Georgii Regis Magnae Britanniae, Franciae &amp;
Hiberniae decimo, at a Session of the General
Assembly of the Colony of New Jersey, begun
the twenty fourth Day of September, Anno
Domini 1723. and continued by Adjournments

<p>Douglas C. McMurtrie distinguishes three
variant issues of the edition in <i>A Further Note
on the New Jersey Acts of 1723</i> (Somerville,
N.J., 1935); but the Library of Congress copy,
containing 30 numbered and four unnumbered
pages, represents a fourth variant. It is one of
two issues (the other bearing a New York
imprint) in which the type for the later pages
was reset.</p>

<p>In the section on paper money, which has a
prominent place in the New Jersey laws, is an
interesting sidelight on printing history: the
text of an oath to be administered to the printer
upon his delivery of the bills to those authorized
to sign them, requiring him to declare</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That from the time the Letters were set, and fit
to be put in the Press for Printing the Bills of Credit
now by me delivered to you, until the same Bills
were printed, and the Letters unset and put in the
Boxes again, I went at no time out of the Room
in which the said Letters were, without Locking
them up, so as they could not be come at, without
Violence, a false Key, or other Art then unknown
to me; and therefore to the best of my Knowledge
no Copies were printed off but in my Presence; and
that all the Blotters and other Papers whatever,
Printed by the said Letters, which set for printing
the said Bills, to the best of my Knowledge are here
Delivered to you together with the Stamps for the
Indents, and Arms.</p></div>

<p>The Library of Congress copy is bound in
the midst of a folio volume of early New
Jersey laws and ordinances that C. S. Hook
of Atlantic City, a dealer in old law books,
sold to the Library in 1925 for $2,337.50.
Though dilapidated, the volume retains its
original calf binding, and the names of two
early owners are inscribed on its front flyleaf:
"M<sup>r</sup> Bard" and "John Wright Esq:<sup>r</sup>" The
former may well be the same Peter Bard, a
Huguenot immigrant, who served as member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of the Council from 1720 to 1734 and who
was one of those authorized to sign the above-mentioned
bills.</p>

<p>Some authorities doubt that Bradford would
have moved a press to New Jersey for only a
short time and think it more likely that he
actually printed the acts of 1723 in New York.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
In that case the earliest New Jersey imprint
in the Library of Congress would be an 18-page
pamphlet containing an act passed on
June 3, 1757, which James Parker printed at
Woodbridge on the first permanent press in
the Colony: ... <i>A Supplementary Act to the
Act, Entitled, An Act for Better Settling and
Regulating the Militia of this Colony of New-Jersey;
for the Repelling Invasions, and Suppressing
Insurrections and Rebellions; As</i> [sic]
<i>also, for Continuing Such Parts and Clauses of
the Said Laws, as are not Altered or Amended
by This Act</i>. The Library's copy, inscribed
"Capt. Monrow" on its title page, probably
belonged originally to John Monrow, a resident
of Burlington County.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The Central Book Company

<div class="caption">(Benjamin Franklin's <i>Rhode-Island Almanack

</div>

<p>After a stay in prison resulting from his publishing
activities in Boston, James Franklin,
elder brother of Benjamin, chose to settle at
Newport, where he established the first Rhode
Island press in 1727.</p>

<p>When the Library of Congress acquired its
unique copy of Franklin's <i>Rhode-Island Almanack
for the Year 1728</i> in 1879, it was thought
to be the earliest book printed in Rhode Island.
Not until 1953, when copies of two religious
tracts by John Hammett came to light, was it
relegated to third place. Those two tracts were
printed before July 25, 1727, while Franklin's
pseudonymous preface to his almanac is dated
August 30 of that year.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although it may no longer be regarded as
the first Rhode Island book, this small almanac
nevertheless is of exceptional interest. Four
years before Benjamin Franklin inaugurated
<i>Poor Richard's Almanack</i> his elder brother presented
himself in this wise:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tho' I have not given you my <i>proper Name</i>, yet
I assure you I have had one the greatest part of half
an hundred Years; and I know of no Necessity for
parting with it at this Time, since I presume my
Almanack will answer all the Ends design'd without
that Expence. So, wishing you a happy new Year;
bid you adieu.</p>

<p class="author"><i>Poor</i> ROBIN</p>
</div>

<p>James Franklin strove to make his almanac
entertaining, and he did not refrain from injecting
anticlerical gibes or a bit of ribaldry.
He obviously relished such pithy sayings as
"More religion than honesty" and "If you cannot
bite, never show your Teeth."</p>

<p>The Library of Congress purchased its
unique copy for $35 at the Brinley sale of
1879. It then had seven leaves and seemed to
lack an eighth leaf at the end. Much later,
George Winship, librarian of the John Carter
Brown Library, reported a curious happening
in an article that he contributed to <i>The Providence
Sunday Journal</i>, November 19, 1911:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A few weeks ago some one noticed that a leaf
which was bound at the end of a book in the Boston
Public Library had nothing whatever to do
with that book. It was apparently a leaf of an old
almanac, and after some research Alfred B. Page
of the Massachusetts Historical Society Library
was successful in identifying it, not only as the
last leaf of the almanac for 1728, which was
printed in Newport toward the end of the preceding
year, but as the identical leaf which originally
formed a part of the copy now belonging to the
Library of Congress.</p>

<p>The officials in Washington sent their book to
Boston to make certain of the identification, and
in return they have been presented with the missing
member, so long separated from its proper
body. On its way back to Washington, this precious
little waif is making a visit to the State of its origin,
and will be for a few days on exhibition at the John
Carter Brown Library, in company with various of
its contemporary rivals, predecessors and followers.</p></div>

<p>A reprint of the almanac with an introduction
by Mr. Winship, signing himself as Philohistoricus,
was published at this time. And
while at Boston the copy was encased in a
variegated morocco binding by the Hathaway
Book Binding Company on Beacon Street.</p>

<h2><a name="South_Carolina" id="South_Carolina">South Carolina</a></h2>


<p>Printing commenced in South Carolina in 1731
when three competing printers migrated to
Charleston: George Webb, Eleazer Phillips, Jr.,
and Thomas Whitmarsh. They were attracted
by an offer of monetary aid that the government
announced in order to secure a printer
for the Colony.</p>

<p>The earliest Library of Congress copies of
South Carolina imprints issued from the press
of Lewis Timothy (otherwise Louis Timothée),
a Frenchman trained in Holland and
subsequently employed by Benjamin Franklin
at Philadelphia. Through an arrangement with
Franklin he took over the press of Thomas
Whitmarsh after the latter's death in 1733,
Webb having either died or departed from
Charleston and Phillips having died in 1732.
The Library has three Lewis Timothy imprints
dated 1736: Josiah Smith's sermon, <i>The Character
and Duty of Minister and People</i>; the
session laws for November 15, 1733-May 29,
1736, entitled <i>Acts Passed by the General
Assembly of South-Carolina</i>; and Nicholas
Trott's compilation of <i>The Laws of the Province
of South-Carolina</i>. The sermon, advertised
in <i>The South-Carolina Gazette</i> for May 22,
1736, as just published, was completed first.
Still earlier printing, however, is contained in
the first volume of Trott's <i>Laws</i>, though the
volume was not completed until September
1736. Timothy began to print the laws shortly
after November 15, 1734, and the first sheets
were ready in May 1735.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>This publication in two folio volumes is a
landmark of Colonial printing; it was Timothy's
most ambitious undertaking by far, one
he carried out with remarkable taste and skill.
The title page, printed in black and red, is
particularly striking. Nicholas Trott, the editor,
was a learned jurist who played a leading
role in South Carolina's affairs, becoming
chief justice in 1703. In the preface he sets
forth his guiding purpose in compiling the
<i>Laws</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thus I have endeavoured as much as in me lies,
and have spared for no Pains, to make this Work not
only useful, but plain and easy, even to the meanest
Capacity, wherein if I have obtained my End, I shall
not think my Labour ill bestowed: For as every
Man is a Debtor to his Country, and we are not born
only for our selves, so I tho't I could not do a more
useful Service for the Province in which it has
pleased God to cast my Lot for several years past,
than to make such an <i>Edition</i> of the Laws, as
might be of general Use to all the Inhabitants
thereof; that so every one being acquainted with
the Laws of the Place, may readily give Obedience
to the same; in which (next to their religious Duties
to GOD) not only their Duty, but also their Safety
and happiness doth consist.</p></div>

<p>The Library of Congress owns three copies
of this rare book, all lacking some pages. The
copy most distinguished in its provenance bears
on its title page the signature of William Bull,
Jr., five times Acting Governor of South
Carolina between 1760 and 1775. Also on this
title page is the late 18th-century signature of
one Thomas Parker. Another copy is inscribed
"Thomas Farr jun<sup>r</sup>. [another hand:] of St.
Andrew's Parish 12<sup>th</sup>. May 1773"; and in the
following century it was given "With Edward
Logan's kind regards to James Parker Esq. 18
Feb 1868." Thomas Farr can be identified as
a merchant,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but the later names have not
been traced. The third Library copy retains
no marks of previous ownership.</p>

<h2><a name="North_Carolina" id="North_Carolina">North Carolina</a></h2>


<p>The first printer active in North Carolina was
James Davis, a native of Virginia, who probably
received his training from William Parks
at Williamsburg.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Davis settled at New Bern
in 1749, and in the same year he began printing
<i>The Journal of the House of Burgesses</i>.</p>

<p>The earliest North Carolina imprint in the
Library of Congress, printed by Davis in 1751,
is carefully described in its title, <i>A Collection
of All the Public Acts of Assembly, of the
Province of North-Carolina: Now in Force
and Use. Together with the Titles of all such
Laws as are Obsolete, Expired, or Repeal'd.
And also, an exact Table of the Titles of the
Acts in Force, Revised by Commissioners appointed
by an Act of the General Assembly
of the said Province, for that Purpose; and Examined
with the Records, and Confirmed in full
Assembly</i>.</p>

<p>This collection is sometimes called "Swann's
Revisal" after the commissioner William
Swann, who did a major part of the editing
and wrote the dedication to Governor Gabriel
Johnston. One of the acts, passed on March
7, 1746, begins with the preamble, "Whereas
for Want of the Laws of this Province
being Revised and Printed, the Magistrates
are often at a Loss how to discharge their
Duty, and the People transgress many of them
through Want of knowing the same...."
These words reflect not only a shortage of
copies, but also the need to rectify discrepancies
in the manuscript copies by publishing a uniform
text.</p>

<p>Davis did not complete the volume until
about November 15, 1751, when he advertised
it in his newspaper, <i>The North-Carolina
Gazette</i>. Four distinct issues of the edition can
be identified;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and of these, the Library of
Congress owns both the third, in which the
laws of 1751 and 1752 (not shown in the
table) are added, and the fourth, which is
like the third but with a title page dated 1752
and a new table.</p>

<p>The Library's copy of the third issue bears
on the title page the signature of Michael
Payne, a resident of Edenton, N.C., who
served in the State legislature during the
1780's. The Library purchased it in 1936 from
Richard Dillard Dixon of Edenton for $500.
The copy of the fourth issue is signed "Will
Cumming" in an early hand, and it is inscribed
to Samuel F. Phillips, who was Solicitor
General of the United States from 1872 to
1885 and who appears to have been the latest
owner of the book before its addition to the
Library in 1876.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The Boston printer Daniel Fowle felt himself
unjustly punished by the Massachusetts Assembly
for supposedly printing an objectionable
pamphlet in 1754. He consequently removed to
Portsmouth in New Hampshire and started
that Colony's first press in 1756.</p>

<p>The first New Hampshire book, preceded
only by issues of <i>The New-Hampshire Gazette</i>,
was printed by Fowle in the same year.
It is Nathaniel Ames' <i>An Astronomical Diary:
or, An Almanack for the Year of Our Lord
Christ, 1757</i>. The Library of Congress owns
one of four known copies of a singularly interesting
later issue or state of the edition, featuring
on its next-to-last page a historical note
printed within an ornamental border: "<i>The
first</i> Printing Press <i>set up in</i> Portsmouth New
Hampshire, <i>was on August</i> 1756; <i>the</i> Gazette
<i>publish'd the 7th of October; and this</i> Almanack
<i>November following</i>."</p>

<p>Almanacs written by Nathaniel Ames of
Dedham, Mass., were bestsellers in mid-18th
century America. This almanack for the year
1757, evidently reprinted from the Boston
edition, is a somber one reflecting recent set-backs
in England's conflict with France. A
verse on the title page strikes the keynote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><span class="smcap">Minorca's</span> gone! <span class="smcap">Oswego</span> too is lost!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Review the Cause: or <span class="smcap">Britain</span> pays the Cost:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">These sad <span class="smcap">Events</span> have silenced my Muse ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The rebound Library of Congress copy, which
bears no marks of previous ownership, is listed
in the Library catalog of 1878 and presumably
was obtained not long before then.</p>

<p>At about the same time the Library acquired
and similarly rebound two other Daniel Fowle
imprints of undetermined provenance, both of
which are dated 1756 but were published later
than the almanac. There is some question
whether one of them, Jonathan Parsons' <i>Good
News from a Far Country</i>, was begun at Boston
or at Portsmouth. In any event, Fowle placed
the following notice in the November 4, 1756,
issue of his <i>Gazette</i>: "Good News from a far
country: in seven discourses by Rev. Jonathan
Parsons is soon to be published. Five of the
sermons have already been set up and lack of
paper prevents completion until a supply of
paper arrives from London which is probable
at an early date." Not until April 1757 did
Fowle advertise the book for sale.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The other
imprint dated 1756 is Samuel Langdon's <i>The
Excellency of the Word of God, in the Mouth
of a Faithful Minister</i>,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> a sermon delivered on
November 3 and also delayed in printing for
lack of suitable paper. Both books were probably
completed in the early months of 1757 but
dated old style. There is a noticeable difference
between the paper on which they are printed
and the crude paper of the almanac, such as
Fowle used for his newspaper.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress possesses one of
two extant imprints out of four that Adams
is known to have issued at Wilmington in
the latter part of that year: <i>The Wilmington

an annual series of "Wilmington Almanacs,"
all printed by Adams, that were prepared for
the years 1762 to 1794.</p>

<p>The otherwise unknown author, Thomas
Fox (possibly a pseudonym), brings himself to
the reader's attention in this statement:</p>

Almanack for the Year 1762....</p></div>

<p>More interesting than the colorless prose and

tables are the printer's advertisements, such
as the following notice near the end of the

<p>The Library's copy of the almanac has been

This almanac, which the distinguished collector
Wymberley Jones De Renne gave the Library
in 1907, was published by December 8, 1763,
and probably printed very shortly before. The
earliest of Johnston's many official imprints,
predating all his other work except <i>The
Georgia Gazette</i>, are thought to be two acts
advertised in that paper on June 2, 1763. They
are entitled <i>An Act to Prevent Stealing of
Horses and Neat Cattle; and for the More Effectual
Discovery and Punishment of Such Persons
as Shall Unlawfully Brand, Mark, or Kill
the Same</i> and <i>An Act for Ascertaining the
Qualifications of Jurors, and for Establishing
the Method of Balloting and Summoning of
Jurors in the Province of Georgia</i>. They had
been passed on March 27, 1759, and April 24,
1760, and were printed in folio in four and
six pages, respectively. Both acts are represented
in the Library of Congress bound volume of
early Georgia laws. Only two other copies of
each are known to be extant.</p>

<p>Various owners inscribed their name in this
book. Joseph Stiles, who operated the Vale
Royal Plantation near Savannah from 1806
until his death in 1838, owned at least the latter
part of it, where his signature and that of
his son, the evangelist Joseph C. Stiles, may be
seen. Another owner of the same part was
John C. Nicholl (1793-1863), a prominent
lawyer and jurist who served as mayor of
Savannah in 1836 and 1837. A later owner
of the entire volume was a certain S. H. McIntire,
not known to have any Savannah connections,
who inscribed it in June 1878. The
Library of Congress purchased it in June 1909
from the Statute Law Book Company of Washington,
D.C. for $2,500.</p>

<p>Only after printing penetrated the Thirteen
Colonies did the French printer Denis Braud
carry the art to Louisiana. His earliest known
work, an official broadside concerning the transfer
of Louisiana from French to Spanish ownership,
was printed at New Orleans in 1764.</p>

<p>The earliest Louisiana imprint in the Library
of Congress is the second extant example of
Louisiana printing. The Library's unique copy
is a four-page, folio-sized document signed by
Garic, clerk of the Superior Council of Louisiana,
and headed, "EXTRAIT De Régistres, des
Audiances du Conseil Supérieur, de la Province
de la Loüisiane. Du 7. May 1765. ENTRE
L'ABBE DE L'ISLE DIEU, Vicaire Général du
Diocèse de Québec, &amp; de cette Province, Demandeur
en Requête, le Procureur Général du
Roi, joint." It is a decree restricting the activities
of the Capuchin friar Hilaire Genoveaux
and suppressing a catechism circulated by him
which apparently had also been printed at New
Orleans. The title of the catechism, as preserved
in the text of the decree, is <i>Catechisme pour la
Province de la Loüisianne, &amp;c. Rédigé par le
R. P. Hilaire, Protonotaire du St. Siége &amp;
Supérieur Général de la Mission des Capucins
en ladite Province, pour être seul enseigné dans
sadite Mission</i>. The contemporary importance
of the surviving document lay in its connection
with a far-reaching struggle between the Jesuit
and Franciscan orders over ecclesiastical authority
in Louisiana. Although it contains no imprint
statement naming place of publication or
printer, typographical features of the document
serve to identify it as the work of Denis Braud.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>That this unique copy belonged to an official
archive&mdash;presumably that of the Superior
Council of Louisiana&mdash;the following manuscript
additions make apparent. There is first
a notation: "Joint a la lettre de M. Aubry,
Command. a la Louisianne du 7. May 1765."
(Aubry had succeeded d'Abbadie as commandant,
or governor, after the latter's death
in February 1765.) A second column in manuscript
contains the same date as a filing guide
and this descriptive title: "Arrest du Conseil
Superieur de la Louisianne portant deffense au
Pere Hilaire Capucin de simississer [<i>i. e.</i>
s'immiscer] dans aucune Jurisdiction Ecclesiastique
autre que celle qui lui est permise par
son seul titre de superieur de la mission des
RR. PP. Capucins de cette Colonie." At the
end of the column is a cross reference: "Voyez
les lettres de M. l'Abbe de LIsle Dieu Vicaire
g[e]n[er]al de M. de Quebek en 1759 et 1760
et sa Correspond. a ce sujet."</p>

<p>The subsequent history of this document has
not been traced before October 17, 1905, when
C. F. Libbie &amp; Co auctioned it off with the
library of Israel T. Hunt, a Boston physician.
The Library of Congress was able to obtain it
on that date for $10.45.</p>

<p>Formed as an independent republic in 1777,
Vermont in the next year appointed the
brothers Alden and Judah Padock Spooner of
Connecticut to be her official printers. Publications
under their imprint were issued at
Dresden, before and later named Hanover, in
1778 and 1779; but in February 1779 this
town, along with 15 others east of the Connecticut
River, returned to the jurisdiction of
New Hampshire. The earliest printing from
within the present borders of Vermont came
from the town of Westminster, where Judah
Padock Spooner and Timothy Green, son of the
State Printer of Connecticut, undertook the
official printing late in 1780.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress possesses three
Dresden imprints dated 1779. The first two
listed here name Alden Spooner as printer,
while the third names both brothers. They are
Ira Allen's <i>A Vindication of the Conduct of
the General Assembly of the State of Vermont,
Held at Windsor in October 1778, Against
Allegations and Remarks of the Protesting
Members, With Observations on Their Proceedings
at a Convention Held at Cornish, on
the 9th Day of December 1778</i>; Ethan Allen's
<i>A Vindication of the Opposition of the Inhabitants
of Vermont to the Government of
New-York, and of Their Right to Form into
an Independent State. Humbly Submitted to
the Consideration of the Impartial World</i>; and
<i>Acts and Laws of the State of Vermont, in
America</i>. The earliest of the three would appear
to be Ira Allen's 48-page <i>Vindication</i>,
known from a printer's bill of February 10,
1779, to have been produced by then in 450
copies.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The Library's rebound copy is inscribed
"from y<sup>e</sup> author" beneath its imprint statement,
and at the head of the title page is written,
"Nath<sup>l</sup> Peabody<sup>s</sup> Book." Nathaniel Peabody
(1741-1823), a New Hampshire legislator,
served as a delegate to the Continental Congress
in 1779 and 1780. His book was ultimately
listed in the <i>Catalogue of Books Added
to the Library of Congress During the Year
1871</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The Library holds the other two Dresden
imprints in duplicate. A copy of the <i>Acts and
Laws</i> was formerly in the Hazard Pamphlets,
acquired with the collection of Peter Force (see
p. 8, above). Ebenezer Hazard (1744-1817)
was an early collector of Americana. The two
copies of Ethan Allen's <i>Vindication</i>, both
printed on blue paper, are in the Hazard
Pamphlets, volume 47, number 3, and in
Colonial Pamphlets, volume 19, number 6. The
latter pamphlet volume originally formed part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of Thomas Jefferson's library, obtained by the
Congress in 1815 (see p. 3, above).<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The earliest example of printing from
present-day Vermont in the Library is a document
printed by Judah Padock Spooner at
Westminster in 1781<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>: <i>Acts and Laws, Passed
by the General Assembly of the Representatives
of the State of Vermont, at their Session at
Windsor, April 1781</i>. In four pages, it contains
only "An Act for the Purpose of emitting
a Sum of Money, and directing the Redemption
of the same." The Act provides for a land tax,
stating in justification that "The Land is the
great Object of the present War, and receives
the most solid Protection of any Estate, a very
large Part of which has hitherto paid no Part
of the great Cost arisen in defending it, whilst
the Blood and Treasure of the Inhabitants of
the State has been spent to protect it, who
many of them owned but a very small part
thereof."</p>

<p>The Library of Congress copy bears the following
inscription: "Secry's Office 10<sup>th</sup> August
1785. The preceding is a true Copy of an Act
passed by the Legislature of the State of Vermont
April 14<sup>th</sup> 1781&mdash;Attest Micah Townsend,
Secry." Although a loyalist, Micah Townsend
served as secretary of state in Vermont
from October 1781 until 1789.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The Library's
copy also bears the autograph of a private
owner, Henry Stevens of Barnet, Vt., first
president of the Vermont Historical Society.
After his death in 1867, his son Henry Stevens,
the bookseller, wrote that he left his home
"full of books and historical manuscripts, the
delight of his youth, the companions of his
manhood, and the solace of his old age."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> To
judge from its present library binding, this thin
volume has been in the Library of Congress
collections since the 19th century.</p>

<p>Dr. William Charles Wells, one of many
American loyalists who took refuge in Florida,
introduced printing at St. Augustine in 1783.
There he published a loyalist paper, <i>The East-Florida
Gazette</i>, under the imprint of his elder
brother, the Charleston printer John Wells, and
with the assistance of a pressman named
Charles Wright. Apart from two books of 1784
bearing John Wells' imprint and a document
printed at Amelia Island in 1817 during the
Spanish rule, no other Florida publications
survive from the years preceding United States
acquisition of the territory.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Richard W. Edes, grandson of the Boston
printer Benjamin Edes, reestablished printing
at St. Augustine, issuing the first number of
his weekly paper, the <i>Florida Gazette</i>, on the
day of the transfer of Florida's administration,
July 14, 1821. The Library of Congress holds
10 issues, constituting the best surviving file of
this paper. The earliest Florida printing in the
Library is the third issue, published July 28
and the earliest issue extant. This happens to
be a very curious example of printing. Of its
four pages the second is half blank and the
third is totally blank, the following explanation
being given:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">TO OUR PATRONS.</p>

<p>We are under the disagreeable necessity of issuing
this number of the Gazette, in its present form, owing
to a very lengthy advertisement, (occupying
seven columns) being ordered out the moment the
paper was ready for the Press. It being a personal
controversy between Mr. <i>William Robertson</i>, and
Messrs. <i>Hernandez, Kingsley</i> and <i>Yonge</i>, Esquires,
and a reply to Mr. Hernandez's publication of last
week, our readers would not have found it very
interesting. Its publication was countermanded on
account of an amicable arrangement being made by
the parties about one o'clock this day.</p>

<p>We hope this will be a sufficient apology to our
subscribers for the manner in which the Paper
appears, as it is impossible for it to be issued this
day in any other way, being short of hands. We
pledge ourselves another instance of the kind shall
never occur&mdash;and assure the public we feel much
aggrieved at the imposition. The advertisement of
Mr. Wm. Robertson, headed "<i>Caution</i>" and the
reply by J. M. Hernandez, Esq. will be discontinued
after this week, and no further altercation between
the parties will be permitted thro' the medium of
this Press.</p></div>

<p>The printed portions of this early issue include
an installment of a "Historical Sketch of
Florida," extracts from various newspapers, and
among others the printer's own advertisements:
"COMMERCIAL BLANKS, For Sale at this
Office. <i>Also</i>, Blank Deeds, Mortgages, &amp;c. &amp;c."
"Blank Bills of Lading, For Sale at the Gazette
Office" and "BOOK AND JOB PRINTING,
Of every description, executed at this Office."
In this century the Library bound the 10 issues
into a single volume. Those dated November
24 and December 1 are addressed in ink to the
Department of State at Washington.</p>

<p>From the same year the Library of Congress
holds 13 issues of <i>The Floridian</i>, published at
Pensacola beginning August 18, some of which
are also addressed to the Department of State.
From this year, too, the Library possesses
<i>Ordinances, by Major-General Andrew Jackson,
Governor of the Provinces of the Floridas,
Exercising the Powers of the Captain-General,
and of the Intendant of the Island of Cuba,
Over the Said Provinces, and of the Governors
of Said Provinces Respectively</i>, printed at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Augustine by Edes. This pamphlet-sized volume
was advertised as "just published" in the
September 15 issue of the <i>Florida Gazette</i>; and
the Library's copy, one of two extant,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> was
autographed twice by "John Rodman Esquire"
at St. Augustine. Since he once added the
designation "Collector" to his name, he is
readily identified as the person who placed the
following announcement in the November 24
issue of the <i>Gazette</i>: "JOHN RODMAN, Attorney
&amp; Counsellor at Law, May be consulted
on professional business, at his Office in the
Custom-House."</p>

<p>Benjamin Titcomb and Thomas B. Wait introduced
printing in the District of Maine, then
part of Massachusetts, with the first issue of
<i>The Falmouth Gazette and Weekly Advertiser</i>,
dated January 1, 1785. Titcomb was a native
of Falmouth, now Portland, who had gained

formerly employed at Boston.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The Library of Congress possesses nine issues
of <i>The Falmouth Gazette</i> from this first year of
printing in Maine. Of these the earliest is a
partly mutilated copy of the second issue, dated
January 8 and featuring a moralistic essay "On
Entrance into Life, and the Conduct of early
Manhood." This issue contains one piece of
news, relayed from a Boston paper, that has
importance for American printing history,
namely, the arrival in this country from Ireland,
"that land of gudgeons," of Mathew Carey,
destined to become a leading printer and publisher
at Philadelphia. Since the Library of
Congress copy is inscribed "Mess<sup>rs</sup> Adams &amp;
Nourse printers," it is interesting to note that
one of the Falmouth news items was reprinted
in their Boston paper, <i>The Independent Chronicle</i>,
for January 20. Similarly, the Library's
copy of the August 13 issue of the <i>Gazette</i> is
addressed in manuscript to the famous printer
Isaiah Thomas at Worcester, and it retains his
editorial markings for the reprinting of two
sections&mdash;a news item and a poem on atheism&mdash;that
subsequently appeared in the September 1
and September 8 issues of <i>Thomas's Massachusetts
Spy; or, The Worcester Gazette</i>. It was
largely by means of just such borrowing
amongst themselves that most early American
newspapers were put together.</p>

<p>Four of the Library's nine issues, including
the Isaiah Thomas copy, were purchased from
Goodspeed's Book Shop for $13.50 in 1939.
Four of the remaining five, including the very
earliest, appear from their physical condition
to have a common provenance. The five were
listed initially in the 1936 edition of <i>A Checklist

<h2><a name="Kentucky" id="Kentucky">Kentucky</a></h2>


<p>The printing history of Kentucky begins with
the August 11, 1787, issue of a Lexington
newspaper, <i>The Kentucke Gazette</i>. John Bradford
of Fauquier County, Va., established this
paper in partnership with his younger brother,
Fielding. They purchased their press at Philadelphia
in the spring of 1787 and transported
it to Lexington by way of Pittsburgh, where
the first press to cross the Alleghenies had been
active since the preceding summer.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The earliest Kentucky imprint in the Library
of Congress is <i>The Kentucke Gazette</i> for March
1, 1788. Like five other issues of the paper,
available at the Library in facsimile, this
original issue opens with "Extracts from the
journals of a convention begun and held for
the district of Kentucky at Danville in the
county of Mercer on the 17th day of September
1787." The extracts are resolutions looking
towards the separation of Kentucky from Virginia,
and the following one accounts for their
publication in this paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Resolved]<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> That full opportunity may be given
to the good people of exercising their right of suffrage
on an occasion so interesting to them, each of
the officers so holding elections, shall continue the
same from day to day, for five days including the
first day, and shall cause these resolutions to be read
immediately preceeding the opening of the election
at the door of the courthouse, or other convenient
place; and that Mr. Bradford be requested to publish
the same in his Kentucky Gazette, six weeks successively,
immediately preceeding the time of holding
said elections.</p></div>

<p>At a time for important decisions <i>The Kentucke
Gazette</i> served as a means of airing
different opinions on statehood, independence,
and constitutional questions. A long second
portion of this March 1 issue is an essay on
liberty and equality signed by "Republicus."
Critical of certain sections of the proposed
Federal Constitution, he opposes a bicameral
legislature, fears undue influence of the Congress
over State elections, and denounces any
condoning of slavery. The remainder of the
issue includes an announcement of the ice
breaking up on the Ohio River, a report of
an Indian raid, and an advertisement in this
vein: "I have been told that a certain Jordan
Harris asserted in a public and very positive
manner, that I had acknowledged myself a liar
and a scoundrel in a letter to maj. Crittenden."
The writer, Humphrey Marshall, concludes
that if said letter is published, "the public will
then see who is the liar and the scoundrel."
This early issue bears the name of the subscriber
Richard Eastin, one of the first justices
of the peace in Jefferson County.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The Library's only other examples of Kentucky
printing from 1788 are eight additional
issues of the <i>Gazette</i>, for November 8 through
December 27, which have been detached from
a bound volume and are still joined together.
These belonged to Walter Carr, who was
serving as a magistrate in Fayette County by
1792 and who in 1799 attended the convention
to form the second constitution of Kentucky.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Nothing more can be ascertained about the
acquisition of these holdings than that the
March 1 issue is first listed in the 1912 edition
and that the later issues are first listed in the
1936 edition of <i>A Checklist of American
Eighteenth-Century Newspapers in the Library
of Congress</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="West_Virginia" id="West_Virginia">West Virginia</a></h2>


<p>Late in 1790 Nathaniel Willis, grandfather of
the writer Nathaniel Parker Willis, established
at Shepherdstown the first press within the
present boundaries of West Virginia. For some
years he had published <i>The Independent
Chronicle</i> at Boston, and earlier in 1790 he
had been printing at Winchester, Va. At Shepherdstown
Willis published <i>The Potowmac
Guardian, and Berkeley Advertiser</i> from November
1790 at least through December 1791.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
By April 1792 he had moved to Martinsburg,
where he continued publishing his newspaper
under the same title.</p>

<p>The earliest example of West Virginia printing
in the Library of Congress is a broadside
printed at Martinsburg in 1792. Entitled
<i>Charter of the Town of Woodstock</i> [Pa.], it
consists of the printed text of a legal document
in the name of one John Hopwood and dated
November 8, 1791. The preamble of the document
reveals its nature:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas I John Hopwood, of Fayette-County, and
Commonwealth of <i>Pennsylvania</i>, have surveyed and
laid out into convenient lots or parcels, for the
purpose of erecting a Town thereon, the quantity of
two hundred acres of land, being part of the tract of
land on which I now live, situate in Union Township,
and County aforesaid, on the great road leading
from the Town of Union to Fort Cumberland, on
the River Potowmack; and for the purpose of encouraging
the settlement, growth, and prosperity of
the said Town, as laid out agreeable to a plan and
survey thereof, hereunto annexed and recorded, together
with this instrument of writing, have determined
to grant and confirm to all persons, who
shall purchase or become proprietors of any lot or
lots in the said Town, and to their heirs and assigns,
certain privileges, benefits, and advantages herein
after expressed and specified....</p></div>

<p>Access of the proposed town to the Potomac
River is the clue to why this broadside relating
to an otherwise remote location in Pennsylvania
should have been printed in this part
of West Virginia.</p>

<p>The <i>Charter</i> is the third recorded West Virginia
imprint apart from newspaper issues, and
the Library of Congress has the only known
copy. Written on the verso is: Col. Morr[&mdash;&mdash;]
And other early hands have written there,
"Hopwoods deeds" and "no body will have his
Lotts."</p>

<p>At the Anderson Galleries sale of Americana
held at New York on November 9, 1927, the
presumed same copy of the <i>Charter</i> was sold
from the library of Arthur DeLisle, M.D.
(1851-1925), librarian of the Advocates' Library
in Montreal.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It fetched $11. The Library
of Congress obtained it in October 1935 from
the Aldine Book Shop in Brooklyn for $35.</p>

<h2><a name="Tennessee" id="Tennessee">Tennessee</a></h2>


<p>The printers George Roulstone and Robert
Ferguson introduced the first Tennessee printing
at Hawkins Court House, now Rogersville,
with the November 5, 1791, issue of <i>The
Knoxville Gazette</i>. Both men came to the
Tennessee country, or Southwest Territory, by
way of North Carolina. Their newspaper remained
at Hawkins Court House until October
1792, while Knoxville, chosen as the seat of
the Territorial government, was being constructed.</p>

<p>The earliest Tennessee imprint in the Library
of Congress is probably the eight-page official
publication entitled <i>Acts and Ordinances of the
Governor and Judges, of the Territory of the
United States of America South of the River
Ohio</i>, which according to Douglas C. McMurtrie
"was certainly printed by Roulstone at
Knoxville in 1793, though it bears no imprint
to this effect."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Its contents, relating principally
to the definition of separate judicial districts
within the Territory, are dated from June 11,
1792, to March 21, 1793, and the printing
could have been accomplished soon after the
latter date.</p>

<div class="caption"><i>Patch-repairs help to preserve not only the title page
but the first page of the text, which is printed on

</div>

<p>The Library of Congress copy is one of those
afterwards prefixed to and issued with a much
more extensive work printed by Roulstone in
1794: <i>Acts Passed at the First Session of the
General Assembly of the Territory of the
United States of America, South of the River
Ohio, Began and Held at Knoxville, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Monday the Twenty-Fifth Day of August,
M,DCC,XCIV</i>. The Library's volume lost its
1794 title page at an early date, and it is the
exposed second leaf, the title page of 1793,
that bears the inscription, "Theodorick Bland
June 1st 1799." Theodorick Bland (1777-1846)
was to be chancellor of Maryland for
many years. His correspondence preserved by
the Maryland Historical Society reveals that he
practiced law in Tennessee from 1798 to 1801.
From such evidence as its Library of Congress
bookplate, the volume would appear to have
entered the Library around the late 1870's.</p>

<p>The earliest dated example of Tennessee
printing in the Library is the <i>Knoxville Gazette</i>
for June 1, 1793, issued a month after Ferguson
retired from the paper. The issue begins with
a lengthy selection by Benjamin Franklin,
which is prefaced in this way:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Messrs. <i>Printers</i>,</p>

<p>I beg you to publish in your next number of the
Knoxville Gazette, the following extracts, from a
narrative of the massacres in Lancaster county,
Pennsylvania; of a number of friendly Indians, by
persons unknown; written by the late Dr. <i>Benjamin
Franklin</i>, whose many benevolent acts, will immortalize
his memory, and published in a British Magazine,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
in April 1764.</p>

<p class="author">
I am your obedient servant,<br />
W.B.</p>
</div>

<p>The subscriber was undoubtedly William
Blount, the Territorial Governor appointed by
President Washington in 1790, who perhaps
hoped that the sympathy towards Indians expressed
by Franklin might temper public reaction
against Indian raids figuring so large
in the local news. Readers of the same June 1
issue learned of such crimes as the scalping of
a child near Nashville, and they may have
been moved by the following paragraph which
the editor interjected in the news reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Creek nation must be destroyed, or the south
western frontiers, from the mouth of St. Mary's to
the western extremities of Kentucky and Virginia,
will be incessantly harassed by them; and now is
the time. [<i>Delenda est Carthago.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p></div>

<p>Both this issue and the June 15 issue, the
sole Library of Congress holdings of the
<i>Gazette</i> for the year 1793, are inscribed
"Claiborne Watkins, esq<sup>r</sup>." They probably belonged
to the person of that name residing in
Washington County, Va., who served as a
presidential elector in 1792.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<h2><a name="Ohio" id="Ohio">Ohio</a></h2>


<p>William Maxwell of New York, after failing
to establish himself at Lexington, Ky., moved
on to Cincinnati in the Northwest Territory
and thereby became the first Ohio printer. His
work at Cincinnati began with the November
9, 1793, issue of his newspaper, <i>The Centinel
of the North-Western Territory</i>.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The earliest known Ohio book, also printed
by Maxwell, is the earliest example of Ohio
printing to be found at the Library of Congress:
<i>Laws of the Territory of the United
States North-West of the Ohio: Adopted and
Made by the Governour and Judges, in Their
Legislative Capacity, at a Session Begun on
Friday, the XXIX Day of May, One Thousand,
Seven Hundred and Ninety-Five, and Ending
on Tuesday the Twenty-Fifth Day of August
Following</i>.... Dated 1796, "Maxwell's Code,"
as this book is sometimes called, was not the
first publication of Northwest Territory laws,
others having been printed at Philadelphia in
1792 and 1794.</p>

<p>The printer set forth a "Proposal" concerning
the forthcoming work in the <i>Centinel</i> of
July 25, 1795:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>W. Maxwell being appointed by the legislature
to print for them 200 copies of their laws, he thinks
it would be greatly conducive towards the instruction
and common benefit of all the citizens to extend
the impression to 1000 copies.... The price, in
boards, to subscribers, will be at the rate of nineteen
cents for every 50 pages, and to non-subscribers,
thirty cents.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p>He completed the volume in 225 pages, with
numerous printed sidenotes that make it easy
to consult. An incidental reference to printing
occurs in a law for land partition (p. 185-197)
which states that land proprietors "may subscribe
a writing, and publish the same in one
or more of the public News-papers printed in
the Territory, in the State of Kentucky, and
at the seat of government of the United States,
for twelve successive weeks" in order to announce
the appointment of commissioners to
divide their property into lots. Subsequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
advertisements were to be placed in the newspapers
for six weeks to announce a balloting
or drawing for the subdivided lots.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress owns two copies of
this Cincinnati imprint. One, lacking the title
page and final leaf, is bound in a volume of
unknown provenance, possibly obtained about
1912, containing four early editions of Northwest
Territory laws. The other is a separate
copy, lacking the last three leaves. This more
interesting copy has two inscriptions on its
title page, the words written uppermost posing
some difficulty: "Ex Biblioth[eca] Sem[inari]i
[&mdash;&mdash;] S[anc]ti Sulp[icii] Baltimoriensis"; but
they make clear that this copy once belonged
to the Sulpician seminary founded at Baltimore
in 1791 and now named St. Mary's Seminary.
A number of similarly inscribed books still
retained by the seminary were once part of a
special faculty library that merged with the
regular seminary library about 1880. Many
books from the faculty library bear signatures
of individual priests who were their original
owners. Thus the second inscription "Dilhet"
refers to Jean Dilhet (1753-1811), a Sulpician
who spent nine years in this country and was
assigned to the pastorate of Raisin River (then
in the Northwest Territory, in what is now
Monroe County, Mich.) from 1798 to 1804.
During 1804 and 1805 he worked in Detroit
with Father Richard, who later established a
press there (see next section).<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Its absence
from the Library's early catalogs implies that
the present copy was acquired sometime after
1875. Two date stamps indicate that the Library
had it rebound twice, in 1904 and 1947.</p>

<p>In 1796 John McCall, the earliest printer active
in Michigan, issued at Detroit a 16-page Act
of Congress relating to Indian affairs. Apart
from blank forms printed on the same press
before its removal to Canada in 1800, no other
specimens of Michigan printing survive antedating
the press that Father Gabriel Richard,
the influential Sulpician priest, established at
Detroit in 1809.</p>

<p>Entry number 2 in the <i>Preliminary Check
List of Michigan Imprints 1796-1850</i> (Detroit,
1942)<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> describes a 12-page publication said to
exist in a unique copy at the Library of Congress:
<i>To the Honourable the Senate and House
of Representatives of the United States. Memorial
of the citizens of the United States,
situated north of an east and west line, extending
thro' the southward bend of Lake Michigan,
and by the Act of Congress of 30th April 1802
attached to, and made part of the Indiana Territory ...</i>
([Detroit? 1802?]). This entry is,
in bibliographical parlance, a ghost. Actually,
the Library of Congress possesses the work only
as a negative photostat of a manuscript document
which is preserved at the National
Archives.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The earliest <i>bona fide</i> Michigan imprint in
the Library of Congress is <i>L'Ame penitente ou
Le nouveau pensez-y-bien; consideration sur les
ve'rite's eternelles, avec des histoires &amp; des
exemples ...</i> printed at Detroit in 1809. The
printer, James M. Miller, of Utica, N. Y., was
the first of three operators of Father Richard's
press. This particular imprint is the fourth item
in a standard bibliography of the press, which
calls it "the first book of more than 24 pages
printed in Detroit or Michigan."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> As a matter
of fact, it is a very substantial work of 220
pages, albeit in a small duodecimo format. It
is a reprint of a devotional book first published
in France in the 18th century and attributed to
a prolific Jesuit author, Barthélemy Baudrand
(1701-87). As head of the Catholic Church in
the area, Father Richard wanted to make such
religious literature available to the largely
French-speaking inhabitants.</p>

<h2><a name="Mississippi" id="Mississippi">Mississippi</a></h2>


<p>Mississippi's first printer was Andrew Marschalk
of New York, an Army lieutenant stationed
at Walnut Hills, close to the eventual
site of Vicksburg.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> There, probably in 1798, he
attracted attention by printing a ballad on a
small press he had acquired in London. At the
request of Governor Winthrop Sargent, Marschalk
undertook in 1799 to print the laws of
Mississippi Territory, and for that purpose he
built a larger press at Natchez. Late in 1799
a second printer, Ben M. Stokes, purchased this
press from Marschalk and soon commenced a
weekly paper, <i>The Mississippi Gazette</i>. On May
5, 1800, James Green, a printer from Baltimore,
introduced a rival paper at Natchez,
<i>Green's Impartial Observer</i>.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress earliest Mississippi
imprint was designed to controvert remarks by
"The Friend of the People" in <i>Green's Impartial
Observer</i> for November 1, 1800. It is a
small broadside "From the Office of J. Green"
that would seem to corroborate the printer's
impartiality, at least in this particular dispute.
Captioned "To the Public," dated November 8,
1800, and signed by eight members of the new
Territorial House of Representatives, it refers
to "an exaggerated estimate of the supposed
expence attending the second grade of Government";
and it continues, "We therefore consider
it our duty to counteract the nefarious and
factious designs of the persons concerned" in
the anonymous article. Mississippi's second
grade of Territorial government had come
about in 1800 with the creation of a legislature
to enact the laws, theretofore enacted by the
Governor and three judges. The authors of this
broadside itemize the maximum annual expenses
for operating the legislature, concluding
with a comparison of the total estimates: their
$2,870 as opposed to the $15,050 of "The
Friend of the People."</p>

<div class="caption">("To the Public," dated November 8, 1800)</div>
</div>

<p>In addition the Library of Congress has a
lengthy rebuttal to the November 8 statement
on a broadside also captioned "To the Public,"
dated at Natchez "November 15th, 1809" (a
misprint for 1800), and signed "The Friend
of the People." The writer begins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fellow-Citizens,</p>

<p>Of all the extraordinary performances I ever
beheld, the late hand-bill, signed by eight members
of our house of representatives, is the <i>most</i> extraordinary&mdash;and
I doubt not that it will be considered
by the country at large as the legitimate offspring of
the subscribers; being replete with that unauthorized
assumption of power, and those round assertions so
truly characteristic&mdash;propagated for the avowed purpose
of 'undeceiving the people' in a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the first moment, and yet not containing one
authenticated fact for them to found an opinion on&mdash;but
resting all upon their mere <i>dictum</i>, penetrating
into future events, and proclaiming what
<i>shall be</i> the decisions of legislators not yet elected.</p></div>

<p>His argument against his opponents' cost estimates
touches upon certain fundamental issues,
such as the threat of an aristocratic rule if the
stipend for legislators is indeed kept very low.
Towards the end he notes an instance of
intimidation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One thing more I would observe&mdash;a very threatening
letter has been written to the printer denouncing
vengeance on him, if he does not deliver up the
author of "<i>the friend of the people</i>"&mdash;this I take to
be an attempt to frighten and preclude further
investigation, but it will be of little avail when the
interests of my fellow citizens are so deeply
concerned.</p></div>

<p>That James Green, although not named, is the
printer of this second broadside can be demonstrated
by typographical comparison with the
January 24 and February 21, 1801 issues of
<i>Green's Impartial Observer</i>, available at the
Library of Congress.</p>

<p>The two broadsides cited are the only copies
recorded in Douglas C. McMurtrie's <i>A Bibliography
of Mississippi Imprints 1798-1830</i>
(Beauvoir Community, Miss., 1945).<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> They
bear manuscript notations, in an identical hand,
that suggest use in an official archive; and the
earlier broadside is stated to be "from M<sup>r</sup>
Banks, Nov<sup>r</sup> 12<sup>th</sup> 1800." Sutton Bankes, one
of the eight signers, is presumably referred to
here. The second broadside has, besides a brief
caption in this hand, a more elegantly written
address: "His Excellency Winthrop Sergent
Bellemont." Bellemont was one of Governor
Sargent's residences near Natchez.</p>

<p>It is interesting that at the time Governor
Sargent expressed himself privately on the
earlier broadside as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They [the members of the House of Representatives]
are undoubtedly the proper Guardians of their own
honour and Conduct, but nevertheless, will not take
it amiss, in a Communication intended only for
themselves, that I should observe it has always been
Considered derogatory to the Dignity of Public
Bodies, to notice anonymous writings, in the style
and Manner of the Hand Bills,&mdash;it opens a broad
Avenue to Retort and Satire, with many other
obvious and unpleasant Consequences.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p></div>

<h2><a name="Indiana" id="Indiana">Indiana</a></h2>


<p>Elihu Stout, whose family moved from New
Jersey to Kentucky in 1793, probably learned
printing as an apprentice to Kentucky's first
printer, John Bradford. He is known to have
been in Bradford's employ at Lexington in
1798, and later he worked at Nashville. Invited
by Governor William Henry Harrison to do
the official printing for the Indiana Territory,
Stout settled at Vincennes and began publishing
his newspaper, the <i>Indiana Gazette</i>, on July
31, 1804.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The Library of Congress' Indiana holdings
begin with a copy of the second known imprint
excepting newspaper issues, printed by Stout
late in 1804: <i>Laws for the Government of the
District of Louisiana, Passed by the Governor
and Judges of the Indiana Territory, at Their
First Session, Uegun</i> [sic] <i>and Held at Vincennes,
on Monday the First Day of October,
1804</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In March 1804 Congress had divided
the lands of the Louisiana Purchase into two
parts, the southern part becoming the Territory
of Orleans (ultimately the State of Louisiana),
the northern and larger part becoming the
District of Louisiana. As explained in the preamble
to the first law in this collection, "the
Governor and Judges of the Indiana Territory
[were] authorized by an act of Congress to
make Laws for the District of Louisiana." They
possessed this special authority from March
1804 until March 1805.</p>

<p>Fifteen laws make up the 136-page work.
They are written in plain language, and the
10th, "Entitled a law, respecting Slaves," is a
particularly engrossing social document. To
illustrate, its second provision is</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That no slave shall go from the tenements of his
master, or other person with whom he lives without
a pass, or some letter or token, whereby it may
appear that he is proceeding by authority from his
master, employer or overseer, if he does it shall be
lawful for any person to apprehend and carry him
before a justice of the peace to be by his order
punished with stripes, or not, in his discretion.</p></div>

<p>A subsequent compilation of laws made after
the District became the Territory of Louisiana
is described on p. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>, below.</p>

<h2><a name="Alabama" id="Alabama">Alabama</a></h2>


<p>The earliest extant Alabama imprint is thought
to be <i>The Declaration of the American Citizens
on the Mobile, with Relation to the British
Aggressions. September, 1807</i>, which was
printed "on the Mobile" at an unspecified date.
No one has yet identified the printer of this
five-page statement inspired by the <i>Chesapeake-Leopard</i>
naval engagement. The next surviving
evidence is a bail bond form dated February
24, 1811, and printed at St. Stephens by P. J.
Forster, who is reported to have worked previously
at Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>A second St. Stephens printer, Thomas
Eastin, founded a newspaper called <i>The
Halcyon</i> sometime in 1815, after Alabama
newspapers had already appeared at Fort Stoddert
(1811), Huntsville (1812), and Mobile
(1813). Eastin had formerly worked at Nashville,
at Alexandria, La., and at Natchez in
association with Mississippi's first printer,
Andrew Marschalk.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> His work at St. Stephens
included a 16-page pamphlet, which is among
the three or four earliest Alabama imprints
other than newspaper issues<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and is the first
specimen of Alabama printing in the Library
of Congress. Headed "To the Citizens of Jackson
County," it is signed by Joseph P. Kennedy
and has on its final page the imprint, "St.
Stephens (M.T.) Printed by Tho. Eastin. 1815."
Here "M.T." denotes the Mississippi Territory,
which in 1817 divided into the Alabama Territory
and the State of Mississippi. St. Stephens
was an early county seat of Washington County,
now part of Alabama, whereas Jackson County,
to whose inhabitants the author addresses himself,
lies within the present Mississippi borders.</p>

<p>Joseph Pulaski Kennedy wrote this pamphlet
after an election in which he ran unsuccessfully
against William Crawford of Alabama to represent
Jackson County in the Territorial legislature.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
His stated purpose is to refute "malicious
falsehoods ... industriously circulated"
against him before the election, foremost
among them the charge that but for him
Mobile Point "would never have been retaken";
and he summarizes his actions as an
officer "in the command of the Choctaws of the
United States" during the dangerous final stage
of the War of 1812 when the town of Mobile
nearly fell into British hands.</p>

<p>The only recorded copy of this little-known
pamphlet is inscribed to "James Madison
President of the U States." It owes its preservation

<p>Joseph Charless, with a background of printing
experience in his native Ireland, in Pennsylvania,
and in Kentucky, became the first
man to establish a printing press west of the
Mississippi River. Meriwether Lewis, Governor
of the Territory of Louisiana, was instrumental
in bringing Charless to St. Louis, the Territorial
capital, and there the printer launched his
weekly newspaper, the <i>Missouri Gazette</i>, on
July 12, 1808.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> His awareness of his place in
history is demonstrated by a copy of <i>Charless'
Missouri &amp; Illinois Almanac, for 1818</i>, printed
in 1817, which the State Department Library
transferred to the Library of Congress in
August 1962. It is inscribed: "A tribute of
respect from the first Press that ever crossed
the Mississippi."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The earliest example of Missouri printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
in the Library of Congress is <i>The Laws of the
Territory of Louisiana. Comprising All Those
Which Are Now in Force Within the Same</i>,
printed at St. Louis by Charless with the imprint
date 1808. Besides newspaper issues this
was long thought to be the first Missouri imprint.
A document of April 29, 1809, appearing
on p. 373 proves that it was not completed
until after that date, however, and recent authorities
have relegated it to second or third
place in terms of publication date.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Consisting of 376 numbered pages with a
58-page index, the book is a compilation of
the laws of 1804 and 1806-08. Those of 1804
carry over from the compilation for the District
of Louisiana, which is the Library's earliest
Indiana imprint, and the same law on slavery
quoted on p. 41, above, is among those reprinted.
Typical of the later laws is "An Act
Concerning Strays," from which the following
section is presented for its incidental reference
to printing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sec. 4. Every person taking up a stray horse, mare
or colt, shall within two months after the same is
appraised, provided the owner shall not have claimed
his property during that time, transmit to the
printer of some public newspaper printed within
this territory, a particular description of such stray
or strays and the appraisment thereof, together with
the district and place of residence certified by the
clerk, or by the justice before whom such stray was
appraised, to be inserted in such paper three weeks
succesively, for the advertising of which the printer
shall receive his usual and stated price for inserting
advertisements in his newspaper.</p></div>

<p>In 1809 the <i>Missouri Gazette</i> was still the
only newspaper available to print these advertisements.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress must have obtained
its copy of this book during the final quarter
of the 19th century, when the "Law Department"
stamp on the title page was in use.</p>

dated "Nacogdoches, 25 de Mayo, de 1813,"
which is preserved at the National Archives
and is the earliest evidence of printing activity
in Texas. A political dispute forced the removal

both the press and the paper in the
summer of 1832, and until July 1833 he continued
to publish the paper at Brazoria under
a new name, <i>The Constitutional Advocate and
Texas Public Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>The earliest Texas printing in the Library
of Congress is the number of the paper dated
June 15, 1833, which offers news only from
the United States and from overseas. "From
the City of Mexico," writes Anthony, "we have
heard nothing this week, except mere disjointed
rumors from the interior. By the arrival
of the next mail at San Felipe, we may reasonably
expect that some certain intelligence will
be received, of what the legislatures have done."
Gathering news was one problem; he reveals
another in the following paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are glad to be able at length, to present the
ADVOCATE to our readers, on a sheet of its accustomed
size. We stated before, that its being diminished
two columns lately, was the consequence
of a mistake made by our merchant in filling our
order for paper. We now have an ample supply, and
of excellent quality, so that we shall have no more
apologies to offer on that score. These things, however,
cost money, and that in hand, which we hope
our good friends will not altogether forget.</p></div>

<p>Among the advertisements is the usual "JOB
PRINTING DONE AT THIS OFFICE" and
also an announcement of the "CONSTITUTION
OF TEXAS, With or without the
Memorial, For Sale at this Office and at the
stores of W. C. White, San Felipe: David
Ayres, Montville: and T. W. Moore, Harrisburg."
Anthony printed these historic documents
shortly after the Texas convention held
at San Felipe in April, and the <i>Advocate</i> began
to carry this advertisement on May 11, 1833.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The Library's copy of the four-page newspaper
has been removed from a bound volume.
Since it is inscribed "Intelligencer, W. C.," it
was obviously sent to the office of the <i>National
Intelligencer</i> at Washington City, as the capital
was then called. It is slightly mutilated: an
item has been cut from an outer column,
affecting the third and fourth pages. There is
no record of the issue in <i>A Check List of
American Newspapers in the Library of Congress</i>
(1901), but its location does appear in
the union list, <i>American Newspapers 1821-1936</i>

<p>Illinois' first printing took place at Kaskaskia,
the no longer existent Territorial capital. In
1814 Governor Ninian Edwards induced the
Kentucky printer Matthew Duncan to settle
there, and probably in May of that year Duncan
founded a weekly newspaper, <i>The Illinois
Herald</i>.</p>

<p>The earliest Illinois imprint in the Library
of Congress, listed as number 4 in Cecil K.
Byrd's definitive bibliography, is <i>Laws of the
Territory of Illinois, Revised and Digested
under the Authority of the Legislature. By
Nathaniel Pope</i>, published by Duncan in two
volumes dated June 2 and July 4, 1815.
Nathaniel Pope (1784-1850), who prepared
this earliest digest of Illinois statutes, went to
Kaskaskia upon being appointed secretary of
the newly authorized Illinois Territory and
did important organizational work there in the
spring of 1809 before Governor Edwards' arrival.
On December 24, 1814, the legislature
decreed that Pope should receive $300 "for
revising the laws of this Territory making an
index to the same, and superintending the
printing thereof."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The work he produced was
to a large extent based on an 1807 revision of
the laws of the Indiana Territory, from which
Illinois had recently been separated.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Even though it paid him for his labor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
authorized printing, the Illinois Legislature
never enacted Pope's digest into law. Nevertheless,
the work had a certain importance, as
explained by its 20th-century editor, Francis
S. Philbrick:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The first thing that anyone will notice who opens
this volume is that Pope began the practice of topical-alphabetical
arrangement to which the lawyers
of Illinois have now been accustomed for more than
a hundred years. At the time of its appearance the
work's importance was increased by the fact that it
collected, so far as deemed consistent and still in
force, the laws of 1812, 1813, and 1814. These
enactments&mdash;though presumably all accessible in
manuscript, for a time, at the county seats, and in
many newspapers&mdash;had not all appeared in book
form; nor did they so appear until fifteen years
ago [i. e., in 1920-21]."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p></div>

<p>The Library of Congress set of two rebound

<p>William E. Woodruff, the first Arkansas
printer, was a Long Islander who served his
apprenticeship at Sag Harbor with Alden
Spooner, nephew of the early Vermont printer
of that name. Woodruff transported printing
equipment purchased at Franklin, Tenn., to
the Post of Arkansas, and there, on November
20, 1819, he began to publish <i>The Arkansas
Gazette</i>. He later moved his press to Little
Rock, where the newspaper has continued to
the present day.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>In his <i>History and Bibliography of American
Newspapers 1690-1820</i> (Worcester, Mass.,
1947) Clarence S. Brigham locates the only
complete file of early issues of the <i>Gazette</i> at
the Library of Congress. It must be reported
here, regretfully, that the Library released these
along with later issues for exchange in July
1953 as part of a space-saving operation, after
making microfilm copies for retention. Subsequently
the same file, extending from 1819
to 1875, was described at length under item
649 in Edward Eberstadt and Sons' Catalog 134
(Americana) issued in 1954.</p>

<p>Two copies of the first book published in
Arkansas, printed by Woodruff at the Post of
Arkansas and dated 1821, now share the distinction
of being the earliest specimens of
Arkansas printing in the Library. The fact that
Arkansas officially separated from the Missouri
Territory in July 1819 helps to explain the
title of this book: <i>Laws of the Territory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>

<p>In the initial issue of the <i>Gazette</i> Woodruff
claimed to have established his press entirely
at his own expense. His imprint on these <i>Laws</i>
discloses his eventual employment as official
"printer to the Territory," and among the
resolutions of the new general assembly to be
found in this volume is that of April 1, 1820,
appointing Woodruff to the position. A resolution
of the assembly, approved October 25,
1820, directs how official documents printed
by him were to be distributed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="caption">(Hawaiian Primer, printed by Elisha Loomis.)</div>
</div>

<p>Hawaii's first printer was a young American
named Elisha Loomis, previously employed as
a printer's apprentice at Canandaigua, N.Y. He
arrived at Hawaii with a group of Boston
missionaries in 1820; but use of the printing
press that he brought with him had to be delayed
owing to the lack of a written Hawaiian
language, which the missionaries proceeded to
devise. At a special ceremony held at Honolulu
on January 7, 1822, a few copies of the earliest
Hawaiian imprint were struck off: a broadside
captioned "Lesson I." Its text was afterwards
incorporated in a printed primer of the Hawaiian
language.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Loomis printed 500 copies of the primer in
January, and in September 1822 he printed
2,000 copies of a second edition. The latter
edition is the fifth recorded Hawaiian imprint,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
as well as the earliest to be found among the
Library of Congress holdings. In 16 pages,
without a title page or an imprint statement,
it opens with a section headed "THE ALPHABET"
and includes lists of syllables, lists of
words, and elementary Hawaiian readings of a
religious character consistent with their missionary
purpose.</p>

<p>The Library's copy is shelved in a special
Hawaiiana Collection in the Rare Book Division.
Bound with it is another rare primer in
only four pages, captioned "KA BE-A-BA,"
which Loomis printed in 1824.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The small
volume is in a black, half leather binding, with
an old Library of Congress bookplate marked
"Smithsonian Deposit." Since the final text
page is date-stamped "1 Aug., 1858," the volume
was probably received or bound by the
Smithsonian Institution in that year. The
Smithsonian transferred most of its book collection
to the Library of Congress in 1866-67
and has continued to deposit in the Library
quantities of material which it receives largely
in exchange for its own publications. The
Hawaiian rarities in this particular volume
were cataloged at the Library in 1918.</p>

<p>"With a handful of brevier and an ounce or
two of printer's ink"&mdash;as he later recollected&mdash;Wisconsin's
first printer managed to produce
1,000 lottery tickets at Navarino, now the city
of Green Bay, in 1827. The printer was Albert
G. Ellis, who had previously worked as an
apprentice at Herkimer, N.Y. He could not
undertake regular printing at Navarino before
obtaining a printing press in 1833; then, in
partnership with another young New Yorker
named John V. Suydam, he began to publish
the <i>Green-Bay Intelligencer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The first issue of this newspaper, dated
December 11, 1833, is the oldest example of
Wisconsin printing known to survive, and it
is represented in the Library of Congress collections.
Neatly printed in fine type on a small
sheet, the four-page issue shows professional
competence. The publishers apologize for the
type they use and for the necessity, owing to
limited patronage, of commencing the <i>Intelligencer</i>
on a semimonthly basis. Their front
page features an Indian story entitled "The Red
Head," chosen from some "fabulous tales ...
politely furnished us by a gentleman of this
place, who received them from the mouths of
the native narrators." Inclusion of the story
accords with a stated editorial policy of giving
faithful descriptions of the character and manners
of the natives. Some articles in this issue
concern proposed improvements on the Fox
and Wisconsin Rivers that would open navigation
between Green Bay and the upper Mississippi.
And the question where to locate the
capital of an anticipated Territory of Wisconsin
is another topic of the day. The Territory was
not actually created until 1836.</p>

<p>Aside from its obviously having been detached
from a bound volume, there is no visible
evidence of the Library of Congress copy's past
history. It does not figure in <i>A Check List of
American Newspapers in the Library of Congress</i>
(Washington, 1901); but it is registered
in the union list, <i>American Newspapers 1821-1936</i>
(New York, 1937).</p>

<p>The Library of Congress also owns the only
known copy of <i>Kikinawadendamoiwewin or
almanac, wa aiongin obiboniman debeniminang
iesos, 1834</i>, printed at Green Bay on the <i>Intelligencer</i>
press. Its 14 leaves, printed on one side
only, are within an original paper cover bearing
the manuscript title "Chippewa Almanac." A
document held by the State Historical Society of
Wisconsin reveals that in 1834 the Catholic
mission at Green Bay charged "the Menominee
Nation of Indians" for "an Indian Almanac
rendered by signs equally useful to those among
the Natives who are unable to read their language,
published at Green Bay, 150 copies,
$18"; and that the bill went unpaid.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Since the
almanac was intended for use in the year 1834,
it was likely printed before the end of 1833;
yet there is no evidence to suggest that it
predates the <i>Intelligencer</i>. At the suggestion of
Douglas C. McMurtrie, the Library purchased
its unique copy from the Rosenbach Company
for "$375.00 less usual discount" in 1931.</p>

<p>As early as 1830 Agustín V. Zamorano, executive
secretary of the Mexican territory of Alta
California, was using limited printing equipment
to produce official letterheads. Zamorano
later became proprietor of California's first
regular printing press, which was shipped from
Boston (via Hawaii) and set up at Monterey
about July 1834. While he controlled this
press&mdash;that is, until the uprising in November
1836&mdash;Zamorano appears to have employed
two printers, whose names are unknown.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Under the revolutionary government the

printing in the Library of Congress is the first
known Sonoma issue: <i>Ecspocision</i> [sic] <i>que

is a small pamphlet having 21 pages of text,
preceded by a leaf bearing a woodcut of an
eagle. The text is dated from Sonoma, August
17, 1837, and signed by Mariano G. Vallejo,
beneath whose printed name is a manuscript
flourish.</p>

<p>Don Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo (1807-90)
held the highest military office of Alta California
at the time of writing, his headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>

reforms summarized as follows in Hubert
Howe Bancroft's <i>History of the Pacific States
of North America</i> (San Francisco, 1882-90):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His plan was to prohibit all coasting trade by
foreign vessels, and to transfer the custom-house
from Monterey to San Francisco. In defence of the
first, he adduced the well known practice on the part
of traders of presenting themselves at Monterey with
a few cheap articles for inspection, afterward taking
on board from secure hiding-places the valuable part
of the cargo, to be sold at other ports. Thus the
revenue was grossly defrauded, leaving the government
without funds. By the change proposed not
only would smuggling cease and the revenues be
augmented, but Californians would be encouraged to
become owners of coasting vessels or to build up a
system of inland communication by mule-trains....
The transfer of the custom-house was advocated on
the ground of San Francisco's natural advantages,
the number and wealth of the establishments tributary
to the bay, and the importance of building up
the northern frontier as a matter of foreign policy.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p></div>

<p>General Vallejo was his own printer. In a
manuscript "Historia de California" he says of
his pamphlet, "I wrote the attached statement
of which I sent the original to the governor of
the State and which I printed immediately in
the small printing office that I had in Sonoma
and of which I was the only employee; I had
the printed copies distributed throughout all
parts of California and furthermore I gave
some copies to the captains of merchant ships
that were going to ports in the United States
of America."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The Library of Congress copy shows that
the general left something to be desired as a
printer, some pages being so poorly inked as
to be scarcely legible. This copy&mdash;one of but
four known to bibliographers&mdash;was previously
in the possession of A. B. Thompson of San
Francisco, and the Library purchased it from
him in February 1904 for $15.</p>

<p>By introducing printing at the Shawanoe mission
station in the Indian Territory in March
1834, Jotham Meeker became the first printer
of what is now Kansas. He had learned his
trade at Cincinnati and for some years had
served as a Baptist missionary and printer
among various Indian tribes.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress' earliest example of
Kansas printing is the first number of <i>The
Annual Register of Indian Affairs Within the
Indian (or Western) Territory. Published by
Isaac M'Coy. Shawanoe Baptist Mission House,
Ind. Ter. January 1, 1835</i>. Isaac McCoy (1784-1846),
publisher of four numbers of the
<i>Annual Register</i> between 1835 and 1838, was
a prominent Baptist missionary, who also
served as an Indian agent and strongly advocated
the colonization of western Indians in a
separate state. In this work he gives an account
of the several mission stations operated by
various denominations in the Indian Territory.</p>

<p>The following passage from the first number
of the <i>Annual Register</i> deals with the printer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the Shawanoe station is a printing press in
operation, under the management of Jotham Meeker,
Missionary for the Ottawas.</p>

<p>Mr. Meeker has invented a plan of writing (not
like that of Mr. Guess, the Cherokee), by which,
Indians of any tribe may learn to read in their own
language in a few days. The first experiment was
made with a sprightly Chippewa boy, wholly ignorant
of letters, and of the English language. He
studied three hours each day for nine days; at the
expiration of which time there was put into his
hands a writing of about twenty lines, of the contents
of which he had no knowledge. After looking
over it a few minutes, without the aid of an instructer,
the boy read off the writing, to the unspeakable
satisfaction of the teacher.</p>

<p>Upon this plan elementary school books have
been prepared, and printed, viz.&mdash;In Delaware, two;
in Shawanoe, two; in Putawatomie, one; and two
in Otoe, besides a considerable number of Hymns,
&amp;c. The design succeeds well.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p></div>

<p>Jotham Meeker's surviving journal, from which
extracts have been published,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> affords an interesting
view of his work from December 15,
1834, when McCoy brought him the manuscript,
until January 17, 1835, when he wrote,
"Finish Br. M'Coy's Ann. Reg. a work of 52
pages, including the Cover. 1000 copies."</p>

<p>Another source of information about the
<i>Annual Register</i> is Isaac McCoy's book, <i>History
of Baptist Indian Missions</i> (Washington, New
York, and Utica, 1840), wherein he states,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I published it [the first number] at my own
cost, and circulated it gratuitously. One was sent to
each member of Congress, and to each principal man
in the executive departments of Government.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p></div>

<p>Under the circumstances it is not surprising
that three copies have made their way into
the Library of Congress collections. On their
respective title pages they are addressed in
manuscript to "Hon Nathaniel Silsbee U.S.
Sen," "Hon Jno. Cramer H. Reprs. U S," and
"Hon Lucius Lyon H.R.U.S."</p>

<h2><a name="New_Mexico" id="New_Mexico">New Mexico</a></h2>


<p>The first press of New Mexico was imported
overland from the United States in 1834 to
print <i>El Crepúsculo de la libertad</i>, a short-lived
newspaper supporting the election of its editor,
Antonio Barreiro, to the Mexican congress. It
was operating at Santa Fe by August 1834 with
Ramón Abreu as proprietor and with Jesús
María Baca as printer,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> the latter having
learned his trade in Durango, Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>A broadside in the Library of Congress collections
appears to be a genuine copy of the
earliest extant issue of this press. Entitled
<i>Lista de los ciudadanos que deberan componer
los jurados de imprenta, formada por el
Ayuntamiento de este capital</i>, it lists, in accordance
with Mexican law, 90 men qualified
to be jurors in cases of what the law terms
"denuncias de los escritos."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The broadside is
dated August 14, 1834, signed by "Juan
Gallego, precidente&mdash;Domingo Fernandez, secretario,"
and carries the Ramón Abreu imprint.
This copy must be one of 48 discovered in
1942 in a parcel marked "Benjamin Read
Papers" at the New Mexico Historical Society.
Benjamin Read (1853-1927) was an attorney
who served in the New Mexico Legislature
and who published a number of works on the
State's history.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Before the find in 1942 only
a single copy of the broadside was located.
The authenticity of these 48 copies has been
questioned, but in the opinion of the late
collector Thomas W. Streeter they are originals.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
The Library obtained its copy by exchange
from Edward Eberstadt &amp; Sons in May
1951.</p>

<p>The Library also has the only known copy
of New Mexico's first book, issued by the same
press and dated 1834: <i>Cuaderno de ortografia.
Dedicado a los niños de los señores Martines
de Taos.</i> A metal cut on its title page, oddly
depicting a moose, has been traced to a contemporary
Boston specimen book, which also
displays a pica type identical or very similar
to that used in early New Mexican imprints.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Authorship of the book has been attributed to
Antonio José Martínez (1793-1867), the parish
priest in Taos, who arranged to have the
press and the printer move there in 1835.
From 1826 to 1856 Martínez taught reading,
writing, and arithmetic in his parish,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and he
undoubtedly had this work printed for the
use of his own pupils. It is divided into three
sections: "De las letras," "De los diptongos, uso
de letras mayusculas, acentos y signos de institucion
para las citas," and "De la puntuacion
de la clausula."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The copy of this small book
is soiled and worn from much thumbing. Penciled
on an inner page in an early, childlike
hand is the name "Jesus Maria Baldez." The
Library purchased the book in 1931 from
Aaron Flacks, a Chicago bookseller, for $350
on the same day that it purchased its earliest
Wisconsin almanac (see p. 53, above) and
likewise through the intervention of Douglas
C. McMurtrie.</p>

<p>When the Cherokee Nation migrated from
Georgia to the newly formed Indian Territory,
John Fisher Wheeler, who had been head
printer of the Cherokee Press at New Echota,
proceeded to the Union Mission Station on
the Grand River, near the present location of
Mazie, Okla. There the American Board of
Commissioners for Foreign Missions supplied
him with a new press on which in August
1835 he did the first Oklahoma printing.
Wheeler had served his apprenticeship at
Huntsville, Ala.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>One of two or three extant copies of the
third recorded issue of Oklahoma's first press
is present in the Library of Congress collections:
<i>Istutsi in naktsokv. Or The Child's Book.
By Rev. John Fleming. Missionary of the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions.</i> Printed before October 31, 1835, in
an edition of 500 copies, it is a 24-page primer
with text in the Creek language rendered in
the Pickering alphabet and with woodcut illustrations
of animals and other subjects. A
Creek Indian named James Perryman or Pvhos
Haco ("Grass Crazy") assisted with the translation.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Fleming's work among the Indians has
earned for him a notice in the <i>Dictionary of
American Biography</i>, where his "chief claim to
remembrance" is said to be "that he was the
first to reduce to writing the Muskoki or Creek
language, which was a task of peculiar difficulty
on account of the numerous and puzzling
combinations of consonants involved."</p>

<p>The Library of Congress obtained the rare
copy of its earliest Oklahoma imprint through
the Smithsonian Deposit (see p. 52, above) in
1878.</p>

</div>

<p>The initial issue of the weekly <i>Du Buque
Visitor</i>, dated May 11, 1836, is the oldest
example of Iowa printing. John King, the first
proprietor of this four-page newssheet, acquired
the press on which it was printed at Chillicothe,
Ohio. He employed William Cary Jones of
Chillicothe to "perform the duties of foreman
in the printing office ... and likewise such
other duties in superintending the publication
of the newspaper as may be required,"<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and
he employed the Virginia-born printer Andrew
Keesecker, lately of Galena, Ill., to be the
principal typesetter.</p>

<p>The earliest Iowa printing represented in
the Library of Congress is its partial file of the
<i>Du Buque Visitor</i>, extending from January 18
to May 17, 1837.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> On December 21, 1836, the
proprietorship had passed to W. W. Chapman,
an attorney, and with the issue of February 1,
1837, William H. Turner became the owner.
The paper maintained a high standard throughout
these changes, its issues justly displaying
the motto: "Truth our guide, the public good
our aim." A reduction in the size of certain
issues furnishes evidence of the customary
difficulty of operating a pioneer press. As the
March 15 issue explains, "Within the last two
months, so large an addition has been made to
the subscription list of the Visitor, that our
stock of paper of the usual size is exhausted,
and we are constrained to issue, for a week or
two, a smaller sheet. By the first boat from St.
Louis we shall receive our spring and summer
supply."</p>

<p>The Library's file dates from the period when
Iowa still belonged to the Wisconsin Territory.
An editorial from the Library's earliest issue
advocates independent status:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Division of Wisconsin Territory</span></p>

<p>It gives us pleasure to see that Genl. Jones, our
delegate in congress, has introduced into the house
of representatives a resolution, "to inquire into the
expediency of establishing a seperate [sic] territorial
government for that section of the present
territory of Wisconsin which lies west of the Mississippi
river," and the same resolution has been
introduced into the senate of the United States by
Dr. Linn of Missouri.</p>

<p>We sincerely hope that these resolutions will be
acted upon, and sanctioned by congress&mdash;if sanctioned,
they will have a most important bearing upon
the future interest and prosperity of the people on
this side of the Mississippi. Yes, we would rejoice
that the 'Father of Waters' should be the boundary
to a new territory. The present territory of Wisconsin,
is much too large, and embraces too many conflicting
interests&mdash;the people on the east side of the
Mississippi are jealous of those on the west side, and
the west, of those on the east. Why not, under these
circumstances, give to the people on each side of
the Mississippi separate territorial governments? We
believe that such a measure would be highly satisfactory
to the people throughout the whole of Wisconsin
territory.</p>

<p>The reasons for dividing the present territory of
Wisconsin are, in our opinion, well founded, for
unless the people governed can be united&mdash;unless
their representatives legislate for the good of the
whole territory, there will not be satisfaction&mdash;there
will not be harmony, &amp; the government instituted
to protect the rights of the people, will become an
engine in the hands of one part to oppress the other.</p>

<p>It is, or should be, the policy of the United States,
in the establishment of temporary governments over
her territories, to adopt the best and most judicious
means of guarding the happiness, liberty, and property
of her foster children, so that when they enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the great family of the Union, that they may be
worthy of that exalted station.</p></div>

Visitor</i> after its expiration in May, in an imperfect
file extending from June 17 (the third
number) to December 23. The Library also
has the <i>Wisconsin Territorial Gazette and
Burlington Advertiser</i>, printed at Burlington,
in another incomplete file from July 10 to
December 2. The Library's three files of very
early Iowa newspapers have a common provenance,
as most issues of each file are addressed
in manuscript to the Department of State,
which was in charge of Territorial affairs until
1873. These newspapers were transferred to

In the Library's Broadside Collection (portfolio
19, no. 34) is a printed notice of the Des Moines
Land Company, with text dated from Des Moines,
September 4, 1837. This item cannot have been
printed at Des Moines, since printing did not reach
there until 1849. It is not listed in Alexander
Moffit's "A Checklist of Iowa Imprints 1837-1860,"

<p>The first printing in Idaho&mdash;in fact, in the
entire Pacific Northwest&mdash;was done in 1839
at the Lapwai mission station, by the Clearwater
River, in what is now Nez Perce County.
The printer was Edwin Oscar Hall, originally
of New York, who on orders of the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions
brought to this wilderness site the same small
press he had taken to the Hawaiian Islands in
1835.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Henry Harmon Spalding (1804-74), the
missionary who had requested this press, was
the author of its first issue in Idaho, an eight-page
primer of the native language with an
English title: <i>Nez-Perces First Book: Designed
for Children and New Beginners</i>. In May 1839
Hall printed 400 copies, of which no complete
examples are known to survive. An alphabet
of Roman letters that Spalding utilized to convey
the Indian language proved to be impractical,
and in August the original edition was
replaced by a revised 20-page edition of 500
copies with the same title.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress acquired this edition,
then thought to be the first Idaho book,
in 1911. A few years later the bibliographer
Wilberforce Eames discovered pages of the
earlier edition used as reinforcements in the
paper covers of the later one,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and on February
18, 1922, another interested bibliographer,
Howard M. Ballou, wrote to the Librarian of
Congress:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have had your copy at the Library of Congress
examined by a friend who reports that she can
distinguish that pages 5 and 6 are pasted in the
front cover.</p>

<p>If you will have the covers of the Nez Perces First
Book soaked apart you will find you possess four
pages of this original Oregon book.</p></div>

<p>(By Oregon, of course, he meant the Oregon
country at large rather than the present State.)
The Library did soak apart the covers and
found that it had two copies of the original
leaf paged 5 and 6. One of them, released for
exchange in October 1948, subsequently joined
two other original leaves to form an almost
complete copy in the Coe Collection at Yale
University.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The Library made its fortunate acquisition
with a bid of $7.50 at a Philadelphia auction
sale conducted by Stan V. Henkels on May
23-24, 1911. The item<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> was among a group
of books from the library of Horatio E. Hale
(1817-96), who served as philologist with
the famed Wilkes Expedition of 1838-42. He
probably obtained his copy about 1841, the
year the expedition reached Oregon.</p>

<p>Medare G. Foisy performed the first Oregon
printing in 1845 with type owned by the
Catholic mission at St. Paul. Apparently without
the benefit of a permanent press, he printed
at least two official forms, and there is evidence
that he produced tickets for an election held
on June 3, 1845. Foisy was a French Canadian
who had worked at the Lapwai mission press
for Henry Harmon Spalding (see p. 63, above)
during the fall and winter of 1844-45.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Later certain forward-looking settlers organized
the Oregon Printing Association, obtained
a printing press, hired a printer named
John Fleming, who had migrated to Oregon
from Ohio,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and founded the <i>Oregon Spectator</i>
at Oregon City on February 5, 1846. This was
the earliest English-language newspaper in
North America west of the Missouri River.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
The earliest Oregon printing in the Library
of Congress is the ninth semimonthly number
of the <i>Oregon Spectator</i>, dated May 28, 1846.
It is a small four-page sheet presently bound
with 15 other numbers of the <i>Spectator</i> through
May 13, 1847. All bear the newspaper's motto:
"Westward the Star of Empire takes its way."
When this ninth number was printed, the
Oregon Country was still jointly occupied by
the United States and Great Britain. Shortly
after, on June 15, 1846, the U.S. Senate ratified
the Oregon Treaty, whereby the Oregon Country
was divided at the 49th parallel. News of
the ratification as reported in the New York
<i>Gazette and Times</i> of June 19 reached Honolulu
in time to be printed in the <i>Polynesian</i>
of August 29, and the information was reprinted
from that paper in the November 12
issue of the <i>Spectator</i>, which is included in the
Library's file.</p>

<p>The issue of May 28 has a decidedly political
emphasis because of impending local elections,
and among its articles is an amusing account
of a meeting at which several inexperienced
candidates proved embarrassingly "backward
about speaking." The difficulty of obtaining
information for the paper is illustrated by a
section headed "Foreign News," consisting of
a letter from Peter Ogden, Governor of Fort
Vancouver, in which he gives a brief account
of the political upheaval in Britain over the
Corn Law question. He cites as the source of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
his information a letter he received via "an
express ... from [Fort] Nesqually." He concludes,
"In three or four days hence we shall
receive newspapers, and I trust further particulars."
The last page of this issue is given
entirely to the printing of an installment of
"An Act to establish Courts, and prescribe their
powers and duties," which had been passed by
the provisional legislature.</p>

<p>In addition to its small volume of issues
from 1846 and 1847, the Library of Congress
has an incomplete volume of <i>Spectator</i> issues
from September 12, 1850, to January 27, 1852,
when the paper had a larger format and appeared
weekly. Evidence for the provenance
of the earlier volume is the inscription, "J. B.
McClurg &amp; C.," on the issue of December 24,
1846, designating a Honolulu firm which carried
this advertisement in the same <i>Spectator</i>:</p>

<p>Several issues in the later volume are addressed
either to the "State Department" or to "Hon.
Daniel Webster," who was Secretary of State
at the time. The Library's <i>A Check List of
American Newspapers</i>, published in 1901, records
holdings only for December 12, 1850,
to February 27, 1851, but all of the <i>Spectator</i>
issues look as if they have been in the Library
from an early date.</p>

<p>Brigham Young's nephew Brigham Hamilton
Young was the first printer within the present
boundaries of Utah. A manuscript "Journal
History" of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints records that on January 22,
1849, "Brigham H. Young and Thomas Bullock
were engaged in setting type for the fifty cent
bills, paper currency. This was the first typesetting
in the [Salt Lake] Valley. The bills
were to be printed on the press made by
Truman O. Angell."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The Law Library of the Library of Congress
keeps in a small manila envelope a remarkable
group of five very early examples of Utah
printing, some of which must have been issued
in 1850. The one that seems to be the earliest
has the title <i>Ordinances, Passed by the Legislative
Council of Great Salt Lake City, and
Ordered to be Printed</i>. This piece&mdash;like the
others without indication of place or date of
printing&mdash;may be assigned to a press from
Boston which reached Salt Lake City in August
of 1849 and supplanted the original homemade
press. Listed as number 3 in Douglas C. McMurtrie's
<i>The Beginnings of Printing in Utah,
with a Bibliography of the Issues of the Utah
Press 1849-1860</i> (Chicago, 1931), it is a four-page
leaflet containing nine ordinances passed
between February 24 and December 29, 1849.
Among them are a "Penalty for Riding Horses
Without Leave, Driving Cattle Off the Feeding
Range, &amp;c." and "An Ordinance Creating an
Office for the Recording of 'Marks and Brands'
on Horses, Mules, Cattle, and All Other Stock."</p>

<p>A 34-page pamphlet entitled <i>Constitution
of the State of Deseret</i> (not in McMurtrie;
Sabin 98220) is obviously from the same press.
Appended to the constitution, which was approved
November 20, 1849, are several ordinances
passed between March 9, 1849, and
March 28, 1850. Another issue of this press
(not in McMurtrie or Sabin) is a slightly
mutilated three-page leaflet: <i>Rules and Regulations
for the Governing of Both Houses of
the General Asse{mbly} of the State of Deseret,
When in Joint Session; and for Each Respective
House, When in Separate Session. Adopted
by the Senate and House of Representatives,
December 2, 1850.</i> Of unspecified date is a
single leaf, unrecorded and apparently unique,
captioned <i>Standing Committees of the House</i>.
Finally, there is among these imprints a copy
of the 80-page <i>Ordinances. Passed by the General
Assembly of the State of Deseret</i>, known
as the "Compilation of 1851" and listed as
number 8 by McMurtrie, who writes, "A copy
of the 1851 volume in the library of the Church
Historian's Office was used in 1919 for making
a reprint, but the original has since disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
A copy is said to be in private ownership
in California." The latter is undoubtedly
the one now in the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>The only one of these extremely rare imprints
to show marks of previous ownership is
the "Compilation of 1851." It was autographed
by Phinehas Richards, who served both as
representative and as senator in the provisional
legislature of the state of Deseret. Whether the
other four pieces also belonged to him is not
clear; in any event all five came into the hands
of his son, Franklin Dewey Richards (1821-99),
who for half a century was an Apostle of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,
becoming president of the Apostles' Quorum,
and who served as Church Historian for the
last 10 years of his life.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> A Library of Congress
purchase order dated October 31, 1940, reveals
that these imprints were contained in a bound
volume labeled "Laws of Utah&mdash;F. D. Richards";
that by agreement the Library had them removed
from the volume and subsequently
returned it to Mr. Frank S. Richards, in care
of the San Francisco bookseller John Howell;
and that the price paid for the detached items
was $1,600. Frank S. Richards, an attorney
residing in Piedmont, Calif., is a great-grandson
of Franklin Dewey Richards, most of whose
books he has given to the Bancroft Library of
the University of California.</p>

<p>Minnesota's first printer was James Madison
Goodhue of Hebron, N.H. An Amherst College
graduate, he had abandoned a legal career
to run a pioneer newspaper at Lancaster, Wis.
Shortly after the establishment of the Minnesota
Territory, he moved his printing equipment
to St. Paul, and on April 28, 1849, he
founded his weekly newspaper, <i>The Minnesota
Pioneer</i>. It is reported that even though he
brought along two printers, Goodhue himself
worked both as compositor and pressman, and
further that the printing press he used at
Lancaster and St. Paul was the same on which
Iowa's first printing had been performed.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The
Library of Congress' scattered file of this first
Minnesota newspaper contains just one 1849
issue, dated October 25.</p>

<p>Taking precedence as the Library's earliest
example of Minnesota printing is the first
issue, dated August 25, 1849, of another St.
Paul paper, the <i>Minnesota Chronicle and Register</i>,
which resulted from the merger of two
early rivals of the <i>Pioneer</i>. In an introductory
editorial the proprietors, James Hughes and
John Phillips Owens, make certain claims on
behalf of this paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our union bases us upon a foundation which
renders our permanent success beyond a contingency.
The combining of the two offices places us in possession
of probably the best and most complete
printing establishment on the Mississippi, above St.
Louis. These advantages, with our practical experience
in the art, the aid of health and a free good will,
and a moderate share of the other requisites, we
hope will enable us to give the Chronicle and
Register a place in the front rank of well executed,
useful and instructive newspapers.... We have two
new Washington Printing Presses, with all the recent
improvements attached. We defy any establishment
in the Union to produce superior pieces of machinery
in the way of Hand Presses. Our assortment
of book and job type is also of the newest and handsomest
styles, and comprises larger quantities and
greater varieties than can be found this side of
St. Louis. And we are happy to announce we have
more coming.</p></div>

<p>They also make an interesting statement of
editorial policy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Chronicle and Register have each a reputatation
[sic] at home and abroad, gained during the
few months of their separate existence. The views
of the respective editors in regard to general politics,
and the relation they bear upon these matters to our
present administrations, National and Territorial, has
been a matter of no concealment on the part of
either. And were it not for one reason, we would
here let this subject rest. But the ground Minnesota
at present occupies is neutral. We have no vote in
the Legislative councils of the Nation, no vote for
President. Why should we then divide and distract
our people upon questions that they have no voice
in determining? Why array each other in separate
bands as Whigs and Democrats when such a course
can only show the relative strength of the two
parties, without adding one iota to the prosperity
and welfare of either? The measures of one or the
other of the great parties of the country will receive
the sanction of the next Congress, and no thanks
to Minnesota for her votes. We as citizens, and as
whigs, are willing to leave it for the future to determine
which of these parties are to sway the
destinies of our Territory.</p></div>

<p>The Library has eight issues of the <i>Chronicle
and Register</i> from the year 1849, as well as
later ones through February 17, 1851, all bearing
its motto: "The greatest good for the
greatest number." Many of the earlier issues
are addressed to John M. Clayton, who was
Secretary of State until July 1850, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
later issues are addressed to his successor,
Daniel Webster. (The Library's file of <i>The
Minnesota Pioneer</i> also has a State Department
provenance.)</p>

<p>In addition the Library of Congress owns
three official publications printed by James
Madison Goodhue in 1849: <i>Message from the
Governor of Minnesota Territory to the Two
Houses of the Legislative Assembly, at the
Commencement of the First Session, September
4, 1849</i>; <i>Rules for the Government of the
Council of Minnesota Territory, and Joint
Rules of the Council and House, Adopted at

authorized Goodhue to do its printing, the
newly formed legislature ordered the first two
of these titles printed in editions of 500 and
100 copies, respectively.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The Library copies
of both pamphlets are unbound, without marks
of personal ownership. The first is an older
acquisition of undetermined origin; the second
a 1940 purchase from the Rosenbach Company
in New York, at $165. The third title was
ordered printed in 300 copies on October 1,
1849, the day the Governor's message was
delivered.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> It is a four-page leaflet, one of 73

<p>The earliest recorded example of Washington
printing is the first number of <i>The Columbian</i>,
published at Olympia on September 11, 1852.
The founders of this newspaper were James
W. Wiley and Thornton F. McElroy, who purchased
a press on which the Portland <i>Oregonian</i>
had for a short time been printed and which
before that saw service in California.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>In 1853 the Territory of Washington was
created from the northern part of the Territory
of Oregon, and on April 17, 1854, the new
Territorial legislature elected James W. Wiley
to be Washington's first official printer. The
earliest specimen of Washington printing held
by the Library of Congress appears to be the
following example of his work, printed at
Olympia in 1855: <i>Acts of the Legislative
Assembly of the Territory of Washington,
Passed at the Second Regular Session, Begun
and Held at Olympia, December 4, 1854, in
the Seventy-Ninth Year of American Independence</i>.
It includes an act passed at the second
session, on February 1, 1855, specifying
the size and distribution of the original edition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sec. 1. <i>Be it enacted by the Legislative Assembly
of the Territory of Washington</i>, That the Public
Printer be, and is hereby required to print in
pamphlet form, six hundred copies of the laws of the
present session, and a like number of the laws of the
last session of the Legislative Assembly....</p>

<p>Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the
territory to forward to each county auditor in the
territory fifteen copies of the laws of each session
for the use of the county officers, and two copies for
each member of the Legislative Assembly, and to
each officer of the Legislative Assembly, one copy of
said laws.</p></div>

<p>The Library owns three copies of this 75-page
official document, all acquired probably during
the last quarter of the 19th century. They are
in old Library bindings and bear no marks of
prior ownership.</p>

<p>Among the Library's collections are five
other Olympia imprints of the same year but
from the press of the second official printer,
George B. Goudy, who was elected on January
27, 1855. One of these, a work of more than
500 pages, the Library also holds in three
copies: <i>Statutes of the Territory of Washington:
Being the Code Passed by the Legislative
Assembly, At Their First Session Begun and
Held at Olympia, February 27th, 1854. Also,
Containing the Declaration of Independence,
the Constitution of the United States, the Organic
Act of Washington Territory, the Donation
Laws, &amp;C., &amp;C.</i> The others are <i>Journal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the Council of the Territory of Washington:
Together With the Memorials and Joint Resolutions
of the First Session of {the} Legislative
Assembly ...</i>; <i>Journal of the House of Representatives
of the Territory of Washington:
Together With the Memorials and Joint Resolutions
of the First Session of the Legislative
Assembly ...</i>; <i>Journal of the Council of the
Territory of Washington, During the Second
Session of the legislative Assembly ...</i>; and
<i>Journal of the House of Representatives of the
Territory of Washington: Being the Second
Session of the Legislative Assembly ...</i>.</p>

<p>Most official printing in the Territories was
paid for by the Federal Government, and
copies of many publications were sent to Washington,
D.C., to meet certain administrative
requirements. In some copies now at the Library
of Congress visible evidence to this effect
remains, as in the above-mentioned Council and
House journals for the second legislative session,
both inscribed to "Library State Dept."
Although the Department of State continued
to exercise broad supervision over the Territories
at this period, supervision of their official
printing was assigned, as it had been since
1842, to the Treasury Department. The cover
or halftitle now bound in at the end of the
above-mentioned House journal for the first
legislative session bears notations made in the
office of the Treasury Department's first comptroller,
who exercised this particular responsibility.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
One is a barely legible record in pencil:
"Recd Oct 14/56 in letter of Sec Mason of
Augt 26/56"; and another is in ink: "Finding
enclosed to Sec Mason March 31/57." These
notations refer to correspondence between the
comptroller and the secretary of the Territory
of Washington about remuneration for printing.
Part of the correspondence is still retained
at the National Archives (in Record Group
217).</p>

<p>Scholarly investigation has revealed that a supposed
early instance of Nebraska printing&mdash;the
Mormon <i>General Epistle</i> "written at Winter
Quarters, Omaha Nation, west bank of Missouri
River, near Council Bluffs, North America, and
signed December 23d, 1847"&mdash;actually issued
from a St. Louis press.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The Library of Congress
copy of this imprint is consequently disqualified
for discussion here, as are also the
Library's three issues of the <i>Omaha Arrow</i>,
beginning with the initial number dated July
28, 1854, since these issues were printed in
Iowa, at Council Bluffs, before Omaha acquired
its own press.</p>

<p>Nebraska printing begins in fact with the
16th number of the <i>Nebraska Palladium</i>, issued
at Bellevue on November 15, 1854. Previously
issued at St. Mary's, Iowa, the paper takes pride
in introducing printing to the newly formed
Territory of Nebraska and identifies the men
responsible:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first printers in our office, and who have set
up the present number, are natives of three different
states&mdash;Ohio, Virginia, and Massachusetts,
namely: Thomas Morton, foreman, Columbus, Ohio
(but Mr. Morton was born in England); A. D. Long,
compositor, Virginia; Henry M. Reed, apprentice,
Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p></div>

<p>The first Nebraska books were printed at
Omaha by the Territorial printers Sherman &amp;
Strickland in 1855, and they are represented in
the Library of Congress collections: <i>Laws,
Resolutions and Memorials, Passed at the Regular
Session of the First General Assembly
of the Territory of Nebraska, Convened at
Omaha City, on the 16th Day of January,

on the Sixteenth Day of March, A. D. 1855</i>;
and <i>Journal of the House of Representatives,
of the First Regular Session of the General
Assembly of the Territory of Nebraska ...</i>.
These three official publications record quite
fully the work of the first Nebraska Legislature,
which consisted of a council of 13 and a house
of 26 members. From later in the same year
the Library owns still another Sherman &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>

W. Izard, Governor of the Territory of Nebraska,
Addressed to the Legislative Assembly,
December 18, 1855</i>. The Governor delivered
this address at the convening of the second
legislature.</p>

<p>The press on which these four books were
printed had been transported to Omaha from
Ohio, and it was used to produce the initial
number of the <i>Omaha Nebraskan</i>, January 17,
1855.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> On March 13, with the approval of a
joint resolution which may be read in the <i>Laws,
Resolutions and Memorials</i>, John H. Sherman
and Joseph B. Strickland became the official
printers of the Territory; and "An Act to provide
for Printing and Distributing the Laws
of Nebraska Territory," also approved on
March 13, stipulated that a thousand copies of
the laws and resolutions of the first legislature
be printed. Two of the thousand copies are
listed as a "present" in <i>Additions Made to the

<h2><a name="South_Dakota" id="South_Dakota">South Dakota</a></h2>


<p>In 1858 the Dakota Land Company sent out
from St. Paul to Sioux Falls a newspaper editor
named Samuel J. Albright, a printer named
J. W. Barnes, and a printing press which
Albright later insisted was the original Goodhue
press (see above, p. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>), despite conflicting
accounts of its history. If his testimony
is correct, the same press introduced printing
in Iowa, Minnesota, and South Dakota. It
appears to have been first used at Sioux Falls
to print a small election notice dated September
20, 1858; in the following summer, it was used
to print South Dakota's first newspaper, <i>The
Democrat</i>.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Establishment of the Territory of Dakota in
1861 attracted a second Dakota press to the
new Territorial capital at Yankton. The earliest
Dakota, or South Dakota, printing in the
Library of Congress is from the newspaper
associated with that press, <i>The Dakotian</i>, first
published on June 6, 1861, by Frank M.
Ziebach and William Freney of Sioux City,
Iowa. The Library's earliest holding is the 13th
number, which is dated April 1, 1862, and exhibits
the paper's motto: "'Let all the Ends
thou aims't at, be thy Country's, thy God's and
Truth's.'&mdash;<i>Wolsey.</i>" This number follows upon
a transfer of the editorship and proprietorship
to Josiah C. Trask of Kansas, who announces,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have secured the interest which Mr. ZIEBACH,
the former publisher of this paper, held in
the office, and have made extensive additions for
book work, &amp;c.&mdash;We are now engaged in executing
the incidental printing of the Legislative Assembly
of this Territory under peculiar disadvantages;
yet we believe it will compare favorably with
the work of many older Territories. We are prepared
to execute any style of printing to the satisfaction
of patrons.</p></div>

<p>By using fine print, Trask was able to present
much material in this four-page issue. Among
its contents are the text of the Governor's
message to the first Territorial legislature and
several U.S. laws passed by the first session of
the 37th Congress. The lead editorial, "What
We Mean to Do," contains the following statement
of policy regarding the Civil War:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At present, there is no room for disagreement in
politics. So far as our knowledge extends, all parties
join heartily in an indorsement of the truly patriotic
and conservative course adopted by the President
in the management of this war. He is not a
patriot who will allow any slight disagreement te
[sic] turn him from a straightforward opposition
to the ambitious men who are now heading a Rebellion
to destroy the fairest Government ever
known. Until this war is ended by a suppression of
the Rebellion, unless a change is forced upon us, we
shall walk with men of ALL parties, in an earnest,
honest purpose to do what we can to strengthen the
arms of ABRAHAM LINCOLN, in whatever acts
he may deem best for the people who have called
him to his present proud position. In this determination
we feel that all our patrons will sustain us.</p></div>

<p>The editorial concludes with an appeal to support
the paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Few persons can know the expense and care
requisite for a publication like this so far West.
We feel that our Territory cannot support more than
one or two papers. One of these must be at the
Capital, and we shall endeavor to make this one
worthy the support of all. We expect to receive
pecuniary encouragement from men of all parties
and all parts. After a few weeks, when we are better
acquainted and our paper is better known, we shall
ask for the assistance which will be due us from
those whom we labor to benefit.</p></div>

<p>A Library of Congress bound volume contains
an incomplete but substantial run of <i>The
Dakotian</i> from April 1, 1862, to December 17,
1864, without any marks of provenance. In
addition the Library owns a file of South
Dakota's third newspaper, <i>The Dakota Republican</i>,
beginning with volume 1, number 31,
published at Vermillion on April 5, 1862. This
newspaper has for its motto "Our Country If
Right, If Wrong, God Forgive, But Our Country
Still!" The Library's issue of April 12, 1862,
is inscribed "Wm H James"&mdash;this would be
William Hartford James of Dakota City, Nebr.,
who served as Acting Governor of Nebraska
in 1871-1872&mdash;and some of its 1868 and 1869
issues are inscribed "Dept of State." All of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
these papers are accounted for in <i>A Check List
of American Newspapers in the Library of
Congress</i> (1901).</p>

Prefixed a Brief Description of the Territory

Single copies of the Council and
House journals were in the Library by 1877.
The Library has four copies of the <i>General
Laws</i> and <i>Private Laws</i>, bound together as
issued; two copies are probably 19th-century
accessions, the third came from the Department
of Interior in 1900, and the fourth was transferred
from an unspecified Government agency
in 1925.</p>

<p>Nevada owes its first printing to W. L.
Jernegan, who in partnership with Alfred
James established a weekly newspaper, the
<i>Territorial Enterprise</i>, at Genoa, then in western
Utah Territory, on December 18, 1858.

<p>The earliest Nevada imprint in the Library
of Congress dates from 1862, the year after
Nevada's establishment as a separate Territory:
<i>Second Annual Message of Governor James
W. Nye, to the Legislature of Nevada Territory,
November 13, 1862. Together with Reports of
Territorial Auditor, Treasurer, and Superintendent
of Public Instruction.</i> Printed at Carson
City by J. T. Goodman &amp; Co., Territorial printers,
this publication has 48 pages, not including
the title page printed on its yellow wrapper.
Joseph T. Goodman was not only involved with
official printing at this time, but he was also
editing the <i>Territorial Enterprise</i>, which was
then located at Virginia City and had become
a daily paper. He is perhaps best remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
for launching Mark Twain on a literary career

1862.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Governor Nye's <i>Second Annual Message</i>
covers an important period of national history.
Strongly pro-Union, it gives an optimistic account
of the year's events in the Civil War
and bestows high praise on Lincoln's preliminary
Emancipation Proclamation of September
22, 1862: "As an engine of war, its formidability
is a powerful warrant of early peace, and
as a measure of humanity, the enlightened
world receives it with acclamations of unbounded
joy." Part of the message concerns
expected consequences from a bill recently
passed by Congress authorizing construction of
a Pacific Railroad, which would profoundly
affect life in Nevada:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No State nor Territory will derive such inestimable
advantage from the road as the Territory of
Nevada. Situated, as we are, in what, during a
great portion of the year, is an almost inaccessible
isolation of wealth; with mountains covered with
perpetual snow frowning down directly upon us
at the west, and with a series of ranges, difficult to
cross, at the east of us, with a wilderness fit only for
the original inhabitants of the waste, stretching away
a thousand miles, and intervening between us and
the frontier of agricultural enterprise; and with no
means of receiving the common necessaries of life,
except through the expensive freightage of tediously
traveling trains of wagons; the value of the road to
us will be beyond calculation.</p></div>

<p>The inscription "Library Depr State" on the
Library of Congress copy indicates it must
have been submitted to the Department of
State, which in 1862 was still in charge of the
United States Territories. A date stamp on its
wrapper suggests that it was transferred to the
Library of Congress by December 1900, while
a stamp on page 2 reveals that it was in
custody of the Library's Division of Documents
in September 1907.</p>

</div>

<p>Printing began in Arizona with the establishment
of <i>The Weekly Arizonian</i>, at the mining
town of Tubac, on March 3, 1859. The Santa
Rita Mining Company, which owned this newspaper,
had imported the first press from Cincinnati,
and the first printers are said to have
been employees of the company named Jack
Sims and George Smithson.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The Library of Congress file of the <i>Arizonian</i>
starts with the issue of August 18, 1859, the
earliest example of Arizona printing now held
by the Library. The paper had removed from
Tubac to Tucson shortly before that date under
rather dramatic circumstances. Edward E. Cross,
its first editor, vigorously opposed a movement
in favor of separating Arizona from New
Mexico and organizing it as an independent
territory. In attacking population statistics put
forward by Sylvester Mowry, the leader of that
movement, Cross impugned Mowry's character,
whereupon Mowry challenged him to a duel,
which was fought with rifles on July 8 without
injury to either party. Mowry subsequently
purchased the printing press and moved it to
Tucson. Under a new editor, J. Howard Wells,
the <i>Arizonian</i>'s positions were completely reversed.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>The issue of August 18 supports the candidacy
of Sylvester Mowry for delegate to Congress,
in an election scheduled for September
1. In view of past events it was understandable
that the paper should encourage a heavy vote,
not only to demonstrate the unity of Arizonians
desiring Territorial status, but also to indicate
the extent of the population. The following
short article relates to the recurrent topic of
numbers:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">A SLIGHT MISTAKE</p>

<p>We understand Col. Bonneville says he has taken
the names of all the Americans, between the Rio
Grande and the Santa Cruz, and they number only
one hundred and eighty. Come and pay us a longer
visit, Colonel, and count again. There are nearly that
number in and around Tucson alone, and there are
a good many of us that dislike to be denationalized
in so summary a manner. The Overland Mail Company
alone, employs some seventy five Americans,
between here and the Rio Grande, and they justly
think, they have a right to be included, as well as the
farmers living on the San Pedro and the Miembres
rivers, it is hardly fair to leave them out. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
nearly as bad as cutting down the Americans on
the Gila and Colorado to twelve. When there are
ten times that number. Try it again Colonel, for evidently
there is a slight mistake, some where.</p></div>

<p>In the same issue is a notice illustrating the
production difficulties characteristic of a frontier
press:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have to apologize to the readers of the
Arizonian, for the delay in issuing this our regular
number; the detention has been unavoidably caused,
by the indisposition of our printer. We hope it may
not occur again, and will not as far as lays in our
power to prevent it.</p></div>

<p>When examined as recently as 1932, a
Library of Congress binding contained 10 issues
of the <i>Arizonian</i> from the year 1859, beginning
July 14; however, that early issue has been
missing from the binding at least since 1948.
One mark of provenance occurs among the
remaining issues: an inscription on the issue
of August 18, the upper half of which has
been cut away but which unquestionably reads,
"Gov Rencher." The recipient was Abraham
Rencher (1798-1883), a distinguished North
Carolinian who was serving as Governor of
the Territory of New Mexico in 1859. By whatever
route, these issues reached the Library
early enough to be recorded in <i>A Check List
of American Newspapers in the Library of
Congress</i> (1901).</p>

<h2><a name="Colorado" id="Colorado">Colorado</a></h2>


<p>The earliest examples of Colorado printing
are the first numbers of two competing newspapers,
which were issued at Denver on April
23, 1859, only about 20 minutes apart.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Taking
precedence was the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>,
published by William N. Byers &amp; Co. and
printed with equipment purchased in Nebraska.
Its printers were John L. Dailey of Ohio, a
member of the company, and W. W. Whipple
of Michigan.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>The Library of Congress recently acquired
its earliest example of Colorado printing, a
broadside entitled <i>Laws and Regulations of the
Miners of the Gregory Diggings District</i>, attributed
to the Byers &amp; Co. press. Printed sometime
after July 16, 1859, it is one of but two
located copies of the first extant Colorado
imprint other than a newspaper or newspaper
extra.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The laws, passed at miners' meetings on
June 8 and July 16, apply to the district named
for John Gregory, whose successful prospecting
helped to stimulate the famous Pike's Peak
gold rush. They were placed in historical context
by Peter C. Schank, assistant chief of the
American-British Law Division in the Library
of Congress, in an article announcing this
acquisition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the laws themselves are intrinsically valuable because
they served as a model for much succeeding
legislation, not only for other mining districts, but
for State and national enactments as well. Despite
the promulgation of California district laws 10 years
earlier, the Gregory laws, perhaps because of the
district's fame, the presence of prospectors with
previous experience in other mining areas, and the
imminent adoption of the first national mining
statute, had a unique influence on the development
of mining law in this country.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p></div>

<p>The lower margin of the Library's copy is
inscribed, "Favor of Stiles E Mills, July 20th
1863." Neither the identity of Mr. Mills nor
the intervening provenance has been established.
In recent years this copy belonged to
Thomas W. Streeter (1883-1965) of Morristown,
N. J., owner of the most important
private library of Americana assembled during
the 20th century. The Library of Congress paid
$2,800 for the broadside at that portion of the
Streeter sale held by Parke-Bernet Galleries
on April 23-24, 1968.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Previously the Library's first example of
Colorado printing was the second issue of a
small newspaper sheet, <i>The Western Mountaineer</i>,
published at Golden City on December
14, 1859. This newspaper was printed on the
same press, actually the first to reach Colorado,
that under different ownership had lost the
close race to print the first newspaper at Denver.
Gold is a prominent topic in this particular
issue, which includes an interesting account of
the prospector, George Andrew Jackson, based
on information he himself supplied. The
Library's copy seems to have been detached
from a bound volume, probably before its listing
in <i>A Check List of American Newspapers
in the Library of Congress</i> (1901). Penciled
on its front page are the name "Lewis Cass
[Esquire?]" and what appears to be another
name beginning with "Amos." Lewis Cass was
Secretary of State at the time of publication.</p>

<h2><a name="Wyoming" id="Wyoming">Wyoming</a></h2>


<p>The oldest relics of Wyoming printing are
June and July 1863 issues of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>,
published at Fort Bridger in what was
then the Territory of Utah. The printer and
publisher of this newspaper was Hiram Brundage,
telegraph operator at the Fort, who had
previously been associated with the Fort Kearney
<i>Herald</i> in the Territory of Nebraska.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> No
printing is known to have been performed in
Wyoming between 1863 and 1867, with the
possible exception of a disputed imprint dated
1866,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and the first permanent Wyoming press
dates from the founding of the <i>Cheyenne
Leader</i> in September 1867.</p>

<p>The earliest example of Wyoming printing
in the Library of Congress is a 24-page pamphlet
printed at Green River by "Freeman &amp;
Bro., book and job printers" in 1868: <i>A Vocabulary
of the Snake, or, Sho-Sho-Nay Dialect
by Joseph A. Gebow, Interpreter. Second Edition,
Revised and Improved, January 1st, 1864.</i>
It was printed on the press of the <i>Frontier
Index</i>, a migratory newspaper which commenced
when the Freemans bought out the
Fort Kearney <i>Herald</i> in Nebraska. This press
moved westward from place to place as the
Union Pacific Railroad penetrated into southern
Wyoming, and it stopped at Green River for
about two months in 1868.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The first edition of Gebow's <i>Vocabulary</i> was
printed at Salt Lake City in 1859, and the first
printing of the second edition at Camp Douglas,
Utah, in 1864. The vocabulary proper is prefaced
only by the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Joseph A. Gebow, having been a resident
in the Mountains for nearly twenty years, has had
ample opportunity of acquiring the language of the
several tribes of Indians, and offers this sample of
Indian Literature, hoping it may beguile many a
tedious hour to the trader, the trapper, and to any
one who feels an interest in the language of the
Aborigines of the Mountains.</p></div>

<p>Even for those unfamiliar with the native
dialect, the words and phrases in English can
be beguiling. Among the phrases chosen for
translation are "Go slow, friend, don't get
mad" and "You done wrong."</p>

<p>The present Library of Congress copy is

to judge from a date stamp it was added to

<h2><a name="Montana" id="Montana">Montana</a></h2>


<p>Authorities do not agree on when or by whom
Montana's first printing was undertaken. It was
either at Bannack or Virginia City, both gold-mining
towns, probably in October 1863.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The earliest Montana imprints in the Library
of Congress were printed at Virginia City in
1866 by John P. Bruce, who owned <i>The Montana
Democrat</i> and was designated Public
Printer. Of these, the first may be an eight-page
pamphlet, <i>Reports of the Auditor, Treasurer,
and Indian Commissioner, of the Territory of
Montana</i>. The latest document incorporated in
the text is dated February 22, 1866, and the
pamphlet was printed in the office of <i>The
Montana Democrat</i> probably not long after
that date. Most likely the second Montana imprint
in the Library is the <i>Message of Governor
Thomas Francis Meagher, to the Legislature of
Montana Territory, Delivered on the 6th Day
of March, 1866</i>. Three thousand copies were
ordered, according to a printed note on the
eighth and final page of this work. Neither of
these two imprints bears any mark of provenance,
and both appear to have entered the
Library before the turn of the century.</p>

<p>Another early example of Montana printing
in the Library is the 22d number, dated April
12, 1866, of <i>The Montana Democrat</i>, a sizable
four-page sheet displaying the paper's motto:
"Be faithful in all accepted trusts." It is addressed
in pencil to the State Department.
From about the same time the Library can
boast two copies of <i>Laws of the Teritory</i> [sic]
<i>of Montana, Passed at the Second Session of
the Legislature, 1866. Beginning March 5,
1866, and Ending April 14, 1866</i>, a work of
54 pages. Although copy one is imperfect,
lacking pages 49-54, it is of interest for the
penciled inscription on its title page: "President
Johnson."</p>

<p>The Library of Congress also owns three
copies of a celebrated Montana book published
at Virginia City in the same year by the proprietors
of <i>The Montana Post</i> press, S. W.
Tilton &amp; Co.: <i>The Vigilantes of Montana, or

City as a teacher and as editor of the

installments. This first edition in book form
contains 228 pages of text. The Library date-stamped
copy one in 1874. Copy two was
deposited for copyright in 1882, the year that
D. W. Tilton put out a second edition. Copy
three bears the signature of Henry Gannett
(1846-1914), geographer of the U.S. Geological
Survey and at the time of his death president
of the National Geographic Society. It
contains a "War Service Library" bookplate
and an "American Library Association Camp

of the <i>Frontier Scout</i>, volume 1, number 2
(the first extant issue), dated July 14, 1864.
The Library's earliest original specimen of
North Dakota printing is a copy of the <i>Frontier
Scout</i>, volume 1, number 9 in a new
series of issues at the paper's second location,
Fort Rice. Dated August 10, 1865, this issue
names Capt. E. G. Adams as editor and Lt. C.
H. Champney as publisher. The Library's copy
is printed on a four-page sheet of blue-ruled
notebook paper.</p>

<p>The contents of the August 10 issue are
almost entirely from the pen of Captain Adams,
who saw fit to run the statement: "Every article
in the paper is original and sees the light for
the first time." A long poem about Columbus,
which he entitled "San Salvador," occupies
most of the front page. More interesting is a
second-page editorial headed "Indian Impolicy,"
rebuking the authorities in Washington
for not allowing General Sully a free hand
in his current operations against the Indians
(whom the editor calls "these miserable land-pirates").
From this issue one gains an impression
that Fort Rice must have been a dreary
post. The following is under date of August 6
in a section captioned "Local Items":</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the Big Horn and Spray [vessels] the Q. M.
Dept. at Fort Rice receive 4500 sacks of corn.
The Mail arrives. The wolves are howling on all
sides tonight; we can see them, some of them are
as large as year old calves. The first cat arrives at
Fort Rice. There are so many rats and mice here it
is a great field for feline missionaries.</p></div>

<p>The Library of Congress obtained its copy
of this issue of the <i>Frontier Scout</i> through an
exchange with the South Dakota Historical
Society in November 1939.</p>

<p>Printing is not known to have been undertaken
by the Russians in Alaska,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> nor can a broadside

be properly considered as Alaskan printing.
The first printing in Alaska evidently followed
its transfer to United States rule on October
18, 1867.</p>

<p>Despite the absence of a bibliography or
trustworthy history of early Alaskan printing,
it seems safe to say that the earliest imprints
were the orders issued by the Military District
of Alaska beginning with General Orders No.
1, dated October 29, 1867.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The District headquarters
were at Sitka. There is no statement
on the orders about place of printing, but it is
difficult to imagine how they could have been
printed elsewhere than Alaska and still have
served their immediate purpose.</p>

<p>The earliest Alaskan printing in the Library
of Congress is a series of general orders dating
from April 11, 1868, to July 1, 1870. These
orders, printed as small sheets and leaflets, are
mostly of a routine character, the majority
reporting courts-martial held at Sitka. In the
General Orders No. 1, of April 11, 1868,
Jefferson C. Davis announces his assumption
of command of the Department of Alaska,
which superseded the Military District of
Alaska on March 18, 1868, and he names the
members of his departmental staff. The orders
are printed on different kinds of paper, including
blue-ruled, and many of them carry official
signatures in manuscript. General Orders No.
13, of December 31, 1868, is stamped: "Received
Adjutant Gen'ls Office Apr 6 1870." The
whole series is bound into a volume, now
destitute of both covers, which was weeded
from the Army War College Library sometime
after World War II. The National War College
transferred it to the Library of Congress in or
about 1953.</p>

<p>Since the facts surrounding the Army press
have yet to be documented, it may be well to
consider the civilian printing of Alaska also.
This apparently began with the initial issue
of <i>The Alaskan Times</i>, dated April 23, 1869,
and printed on a press obtained from San
Francisco.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The <i>Times</i> ceased publication in
1870. Apart from the general orders of 1868-70,
the earliest Alaskan printing in the Library
is its file of <i>The Sitka Post</i> beginning with the
second issue, dated November 5, 1876. The
<i>Post</i>, published in a small six-page format on
the 5th and 20th of each month, was the second
newspaper to be printed in Alaska. Neither
the <i>Times</i> nor the <i>Post</i> identifies its printer.</p>

<p>Featured in the November 5 issue is "The
Cavalry Fight at Brandy Station," an extract
from L. P. Brockett's <i>The Camp, the Battle
Field, and the Hospital</i> (Philadelphia, 1866).
Following this is a forceful editorial on "The
Indian Campaign," which advocates committing
a greater number of U.S. troops to the
war against the Sioux. Certain advertisements
in this issue are noteworthy because they relate
to the paper itself. One is on the fourth page:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We wish to call the Attention of all BUSINESS
MEN who intend to Trade in Alaska to the fact
that The Sitka Post is the Only Newspaper PUBLISHED
in the TERRITORY. It is devoted entirely
to the Interests of ALASKA; will never be made
the organ of any party [o]r ring, political, commercial,
or otherwise; and will make it its object to give
the news of the TERRITORY. ALL ENTERPRISING
MEN who wish to bring their BUSINESS before
the Public of Alaska Territory cannot do better
than by ADVERTISING in The Sitka Post.</p></div>

<p>Another appears on the last page:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>MEN OF ENTERPRISE! TAKE NOTICE! The
SITKA POST Is the only Paper printed in Alaska.
It is the best medium of Advertising. It circulates
in Sitka, Wrangel, Stikeen, Kodiak; Portland, Oregon;
San Francisco, Cal; Baltimore, Md, and Washington,
D. C. Send your Advertisements to J. J.
Daly Editor, Sitka Post, Sitka, A.</p></div>

<p>And there is a brief appeal at the end of the
last page:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Wanted&mdash;More subscribers and contributors to
this paper.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The Library of Congress file of the <i>Post</i> is in
an old Library binding and extends from number
2 without break to the 14th and final
number, dated June 5, 1877. The first page in
the volume bears a Library date stamp of 1877.
Also on the first page is the signature "M.
Baker," preceded by the words "Purchased by"
in a different hand. Thus the file was apparently
assembled by Marcus Baker (1849-1903), a
noted cartographer and writer on Alaska who
was employed from 1873 to 1886 by the U.S.
Coast and Geodetic Survey. Some issues are
addressed in pencil to individual subscribers,
three of whom can be positively identified
from company muster rolls at the National
Archives as members of the 4th Artillery, U.S.
Army, stationed at Sitka. They are "Ord[nance]
Serg[ean]t [George] Go[l]kell"; "H[enry]
Train," a corporal in Company G; and
"W[illiam] J. Welch," a bugler in Company G.</p>
